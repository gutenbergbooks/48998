<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LITTLE MILLINER.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T was too true that the city was growing
rapidly. As yet its arms were not long
enough to embrace the little village of Viger,
but before long they would be, and it was not a
time that the inhabitants looked forward to with
any pleasure. It was not to be wondered at,
for few places were more pleasant to live in.
The houses, half-hidden amid the trees, clustered
around the slim steeple of St. Joseph’s,
which flashed like a naked poniard in the sun.
They were old, and the village was sleepy,
almost dozing, since the mill, behind the rise of
land, on the Blanche had shut down. The
miller had died; and who would trouble to
grind what little grist came to the mill, when
flour was so cheap? But while the beech-groves
lasted, and the Blanche continued to run, it
seemed impossible that any change could come.
The change was coming, however, rapidly enough.
Even now, on still nights, above the noise of
the frogs in the pools, you could hear the rumble
of the street-cars and the faint tinkle of
their bells, and when the air was moist the
whole southern sky was luminous with the reflection
of thousands of gas-lamps. But when
the time came for Viger to be mentioned in the
city papers as one of the outlying wards, what a
change there would be! There would be no
unfenced fields, full of little inequalities and
covered with short grass; there would be no
deep pools, where the quarries had been, and
where the boys pelted the frogs; there would
be no more beech-groves, where the children
could gather nuts; and the dread pool, which
had filled the shaft where old Daigneau, years
ago, mined for gold, would cease to exist. But
in the meantime, the boys of Viger roamed over
the unclosed fields and pelted the frogs, and
the boldest ventured to roll huge stones into
Daigneau’s pit, and only waited to see the green
slime come working up to the surface before
scampering away, their flesh creeping with the
idea that it was old Daigneau himself who was
stirring up the water in a rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>New houses had already commenced to spring
up in all directions, and there was a large influx
of the laboring population which overflows from
large cities. Even on the main street of Viger,
on a lot which had been vacant ever since it
was a lot, the workmen had built a foundation.
After a while it was finished, when men from the
city came and put up the oddest wooden house
that one could imagine. It was perfectly square;
there was a window and a door in front, a window
at the side, and a window upstairs. There
were many surmises as to the probable occupant
of such a diminutive habitation; and the widow
Laroque, who made dresses and trimmed hats,
and whose shop was directly opposite, and next
door to the Post Office, suffered greatly from
unsatisfied curiosity. No one who looked like
the proprietor was ever seen near the place.
The foreman of the laborers who were working
at the house seemed to know nothing; all that
he said, in answer to questions, was: “I have
my orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the house was ready; it was painted
within and without, and Madame Laroque could
scarcely believe her eyes when, one morning, a
man came from the city with a small sign under
his arm and nailed it above the door. It bore
these words: “Mademoiselle Viau, Milliner.”
“Ah!” said Madame Laroque, “the bread is
to be taken out of my mouth.” The next day
came a load of furniture,—not a very large
load, as there was only a small stove, two tables,
a bedstead, three chairs, a sort of lounge, and
two large boxes. The man who brought the
things put them in the house, and locked the
door on them when he went away; then nothing
happened for two weeks, but Madame
Laroque watched. Such a queer little house it
was, as it stood there so new in its coat of gum-colored
paint. It looked just like a square
bandbox which some Titan had made for his
wife; and there seemed no doubt that if you
took hold of the chimney and lifted the roof
off, you would see the gigantic bonnet, with its
strings and ribbons, which the Titaness could
wear to church on Sundays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Laroque wondered how Mademoiselle
Viau would come, whether in a cab, with
her trunks and boxes piled around her, or on
foot, and have her belongings on a cart. She
watched every approaching vehicle for two weeks
in vain; but one morning she saw that a curtain
had been put up on the window opposite, that
it was partly raised, and that a geranium was
standing on the sill. For one hour she never
took her eyes off the door, and at last had the
satisfaction of seeing it open. A trim little
person, not very young, dressed in gray, stepped
out on the platform with her apron full of
crumbs and cast them down for the birds.
Then, without looking around, she went in and
closed the door. It was Mademoiselle Viau.
“The bird is in its nest,” thought the old postmaster,
who lived alone with his mother. All
that Madame Laroque said was: “Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle Viau did not stir out that day,
but on the next she went to the baker’s and the
butcher’s and came over the road to Monsieur
Cuerrier, the postmaster, who also kept a
grocery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, according to her custom,
Madame Laroque called on Madame Cuerrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have a neighbor,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was making purchases to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow she will expect people to make
purchases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very tormenting, this, to have these
irresponsible girls, that no one knows anything
about, setting up shops under our very noses.
Why does she live alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not ask her,” answered Cuerrier, to
whom the question was addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very cool, Monsieur Cuerrier; but
if it was a young man and a postmaster, instead
of a young woman and a milliner, you would
not relish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There can be only one postmaster,” said
Cuerrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Paris, where I practised my art,” said
Monsieur Villeblanc, who was a retired hairdresser,
“there were whole rows of tonsorial
parlors, and every one had enough to do.”
Madame Laroque sniffed, as she always did in
his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see her hat?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, and it was very nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nice! with the flowers all on one side?
I wouldn’t go to St. Thérèse with it on.” St.
Thérèse was the postmaster’s native place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The girl has no taste,” she continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if she hasn’t, you needn’t be afraid
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no choice between you,” said
the retired hairdresser, maliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was a choice between them, and all
the young girls of Viger chose Mademoiselle
Viau. It was said she had such an eye; she
would take a hat and pin a bow on here, and
loop a ribbon there, and cast a flower on somewhere
else, all the time surveying her work with
her head on one side and her mouth bristling
with pins. “There, how do you like that?—put
it on—no, it is not becoming—wait!”
and in a trice the desired change was made.
She had no lack of work from the first; soon
she had too much to do. At all hours of the
day she could be seen sitting at her window,
working, and “she must be making money
fast,” argued Madame Laroque, “for she spends
nothing.” In truth, she spent very little—she
lived so plainly. Three times a week she took
a fresh twist from the baker, once a day, the
milkman left a pint of milk, and once every
week mademoiselle herself stepped out to the
butcher’s and bought a pound of steak. Occasionally
she mailed a letter, which she always
gave into the hands of the postmaster; if he
was not there she asked for a pound of tea or
something else that she needed. She was fast
friends with Cuerrier, but with no one else, as
she never received visitors. Once only did a
young man call on her. It was young Jourdain,
the clerk in the dry-goods store. He had
knocked at the door and was admitted. “Ah!”
said Madame Laroque, “it is the young men
who can conquer.” But the next moment Monsieur
Jourdain came out, and, strangely enough,
was so bewildered as to forget to put on his
hat. It was not this young man who could
conquer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is something mysterious about that
young person,” said Madame Laroque between
her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Cuerrier, “very mysterious—she
minds her own business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” said the widow, “who can tell what
her business is, she who comes from no one
knows where? But I’ll find out what all this
secrecy means, trust me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the widow watched the little house and its
occupant very closely, and these are some of
the things she saw: Every morning an open
door and crumbs for the birds, the watering of
the geranium, which was just going to flower, a
small figure going in and out, dressed in gray,
and, oftener than anything else, the same figure
sitting at the window, working. This continued
for a year with little variation, but still the widow
watched. Every one else had accepted the presence
of the new resident as a benefaction.
They had got accustomed to her. They called
her “the little milliner.” Old Cuerrier called
her “the little one in gray.” But she was not
yet adjusted in the widow’s system of things.
She laid a plot with her second cousin, which
was that the cousin should get a hat made by
Mademoiselle Viau, and that she should ask her
some questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Viau, were you born in the
city?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not think, Mademoiselle, that green
will become you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, perhaps not. Where did you live before
you came here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, this gray shape is very
pretty.” And so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That plan would not work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before long something very suspicious
happened. One evening, just about dusk, as
Madame Laroque was walking up and down in
front of her door, a man of a youthful appearance
came quickly up the street, stepped upon
Mademoiselle Viau’s platform, opened the door
without knocking, and walked in. Mademoiselle
was working in the last vestige of daylight,
and the widow watched her like a lynx. She
worked on unconcernedly, and when it became
so dark that she could not see she lit her lamp
and pulled down the curtain. That night
Madame Laroque did not go into Cuerrier’s.
It commenced to rain, but she put on a large
frieze coat of the deceased Laroque and
crouched in the dark. She was very much
interested in this case, but her interest brought
no additional knowledge. She had seen the
man go in; he was rather young and about the
medium height, and had a black mustache; she
could remember him distinctly, but she did not
see him come out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Mademoiselle Viau’s curtain
went up as usual, and as it was her day to
go to the butcher’s she went out. While she
was away Madame Laroque took a long look in
at the side window, but there was nothing to
see except the lounge and the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Madame Laroque had been watching
in the rain, Cuerrier was reading to Villeblanc
from <span class='it'>Le Monde</span>. “Hello!” said he, and then
went on reading to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you lost your voice?” asked Villeblanc,
getting nettled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no; listen to this—‘Daring Jewel
Robbery. A Thief in the Night.’ ” These
were the headings of the column, and then
followed the particulars. In the morning the
widow borrowed the paper, as she had been
too busy the night before to come and hear it
read. She looked over the front page, when
her eye caught the heading, “Daring Jewel
Robbery,” and she read the whole story. As
she neared the end her eyebrows commenced
to travel up her forehead, as if they were
going to hide in her hair, and with an expression
of surprise she tossed the paper to her
second cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” she said, “read this out to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second cousin commenced to read at
the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no! right here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The man Durocher, who is suspected of
the crime, is not tall, wears a heavy mustache,
has gray eyes, and wears an ear-ring in his left
ear. He has not been seen since Saturday.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you so!” exclaimed the widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me nothing of the kind,” said the
second cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had no ear-ring in his ear,” said the
widow—“but—but—but it was the <span class='it'>right</span>
ear that I saw. Hand me my shawl!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have business; never mind!” She took
the paper with her and went straight to the
constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said he, “I cannot come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no time to be lost; you must
come now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he will be desperate; he will face me
like a lion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind! you will have the reward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, wait!” And the constable went upstairs
to get his pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came down with his blue coat on. He
was a very fat man, and was out of breath when
he came to the little milliner’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who shall I ask for?” he inquired of
Madame Laroque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just search the house, and I will see that
he does not escape by the back door.” She
had forgotten that there was no back door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want a bonnet?” asked Mademoiselle
Viau. She was on excellent terms with
the constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” said he, sternly. “You have a man
in this house, and I have come to find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed?” said mademoiselle, very stiffly.
“Will you be pleased to proceed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said he, taking out his pistol and
cocking it. “I will first look downstairs.”
He did so, and only frightened a cat from
under the stove. No one knew that Mademoiselle
Viau had a cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lead the way upstairs!” commanded the
constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid of your pistol, will you not go
first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went first and entered at once the only
room, for there was no hall. In the mean time
Madame Laroque had found out that there was
no back door, and had come into the lower
flat and reinspected it, looking under everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open that closet!” said the constable, as
he levelled his pistol at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle threw open the door and
sprang away, with her hands over her ears.
There was no one there; neither was there
any one under the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open that trunk!” eying the little leather-covered
box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur, you will respect—but—as you
will.” She stooped over the trunk and threw
back the lid; on the top was a dainty white
skirt, embroidered beautifully. The little milliner
was blushing violently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do!” said the constable. “There
is no one there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out of the road!” he cried to the
knot of people who had collected at the door.
“I have been for my wife’s bonnet; it is not
finished.” But the people looked at his pistol,
which he had forgotten to put away. He went
across to the widow’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” he said, “you had better
stop this or I’ll have the law on you—no
words now! Making a fool of me before the
people—getting me to put on my coat and
bring my pistol to frighten a cat from under
the stove. No words now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Cuerrier,” inquired Madame Laroque
that night, “who is it that Mademoiselle
Viau writes to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am an official of the government. I do
not tell state secrets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“State secrets, indeed! Depend upon it,
there are secrets in those letters which the
state would like to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not my business. I only send the
letters where they are posted, and refuse to
tell amiable widows where they go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hairdresser, forgetting his constant fear of
disarranging his attire, threw back his head and
laughed wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trust a barber to laugh,” said the widow.
Villeblanc sobered up and look sadly at Cuerrier;
he could not bear to be called a barber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you uphold her in this—a person
who comes from no one knows where, and
writes to no one knows who——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know who she writes to——” The widow
got furious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, who she writes to—yes, of course
you do—that person who comes out of her
house without ever having gone into it, and
who is visited by men who go in and never
come out——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know he went in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know he never came out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! then you were watching?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what if I was! The devil has a hand
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt,” said Cuerrier, insinuatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough, fool!” exclaimed the widow—“but
wait, I have not done yet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better rest, or you will have the
law on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow was afraid of the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About six months after this, when the snow
was coming on, a messenger came from the
city with a telegram for Monsieur Cuerrier—at
least, it was in his care. He very seldom
went out, but he got his boots and went across
to Mademoiselle Viau’s. The telegram was for
her. When she had read it she crushed it in
her hand and leaned against the wall. But
she recovered herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur Cuerrier, you have always been a
good friend to me—help me! I must go
away—you will watch my little place when I
am gone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postmaster was struck with pity, and he
assisted her. She left that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Accomplice!</span>” the widow hissed in his ear
the first chance she got.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About three weeks after this, when Madame
Laroque asked for <span class='it'>Le Monde</span>, Cuerrier refused
to give it to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Lost!</span>” said the widow, derisively. “Well,
I will find it.” In an hour she came back with
the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” said she, thrusting it under the
postmaster’s nose so that he could not get his
pipe back to his mouth. Cuerrier looked consciously
at the paragraph which she had pointed
out. He had seen it before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our readers will remember that the police,
while attempting to arrest one Ellwell for the
jewel-robbery which occurred in the city some
time ago, were compelled to fire on the man
in self-defence. He died last night in the arms
of a female relative, who had been sent for at
his request. He was known by various names—Durocher,
Gillet, etc.—and the police have
had much trouble with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” said the widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died in the arms of a female relative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, were you the relative?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! my fine fellow, be careful! Do
you think I would be the female relative of a
convict? Do you not know any of these
names?” The postmaster felt guilty; he did
know one of the names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are common enough,” he replied.
“The name of my aunt’s second husband was
Durocher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will not do!” said the widow. “Somebody
builds a house, no one knows who;
people come and go, no one knows how; and
you, a stupid postmaster, shut your eyes and
help things along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days after this, Mademoiselle Viau
came home. She was no longer the little one
in gray; she was the little one in black. She
came straight to Monsieur Cuerrier to get her
cat. Then she went home. The widow watched
her go in. “Now,” she said, “we will not see
her come out again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle Viau refused to take any more
work. She was sick, she said; she wanted to
rest. She rested for two weeks, and Monsieur
Cuerrier brought her food ready cooked. Then
he stopped; she was better. One evening
Madame Laroque peeped in at the side window.
She saw the little milliner quite distinctly. She
was on her knees, her face was hidden in her
arms. The fire was very bright, and the lamp
was lighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days after that the widow said to Cuerrier:
“It is very strange there is no smoke.
Has Mademoiselle Viau gone away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see her go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as I said—no one has seen her go.
But wait, she will come back; and no one will
see her come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was three years ago, and she has not come
back. All the white curtains are pulled down.
Between the one that covers the front window
and the sash stands the pot in which grew the
geranium. It only had one blossom all the
time it was alive, and it is dead now and looks
like a dry stick. No one knows what will become
of the house. Madame Laroque thinks
that Monsieur Cuerrier knows. She expects,
some morning, to look across and see the little
milliner cast down crumbs for the birds. In
the meantime, in every corner of the house the
spiders are weaving webs, and an enterprising
caterpillar has blocked up the key-hole with his
cocoon.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span><h1>THE DESJARDINS.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>J</span>UST at the foot of the hill, where the bridge
crossed the Blanche, stood one of the oldest
houses in Viger. It was built of massive timbers.
The roof curved and projected beyond
the eaves, forming the top of a narrow veranda.
The whole house was painted a dazzling white
except the window-frames, which were green.
There was a low stone fence between the road
and the garden, where a few simple flowers
grew. Beyond the fence was a row of Lombardy
poplars, some of which had commenced
to die out. On the opposite side of the road
was a marshy field, where by day the marsh
marigolds shone, and by night, the fire-flies.
There were places in this field where you could
thrust down a long pole and not touch bottom.
In the fall a few musk-rats built a house there,
in remembrance of the time when it was a
favorite wintering-ground. In the spring the
Blanche came up and flowed over it. Beyond
that again the hill curved round, with a scarped,
yellowish slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this house lived Adèle Desjardin with her
two brothers, Charles and Philippe. Their
father was dead, and when he died there was
hardly a person in the whole parish who was
sorry. They could remember him as a tall,
dark, forbidding-looking man, with long arms
out of all proportion to his body. He had
inherited his fine farm from his father, and had
added to and improved it. He had always
been prosperous, and was considered the wealthiest
man in the parish. He was inhospitable,
and became more taciturn and morose after his
wife died. His pride was excessive and kept
him from associating with his neighbors, although
he was in no way above them. Very
little was known about his manner of life, and
there was a mystery about his father’s death.
For some time the old man had not been seen
about the place, when one day he came from
the city, dead, and in his coffin, which was
thought strange. This gave rise to all sorts of
rumor and gossip; but the generally accredited
story was, that there was insanity in the family
and that he had died crazy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However cold Isidore Desjardin was to his
neighbors, no one could have charged him with
being unkind or harsh with his children, and as
they grew up he gave them all the advantages
which it was possible for them to have. Adèle
went for a year to the Convent of the Sacre Cœur
in the city, and could play tunes on the piano
when she came back; so that she had to have a
piano of her own, which was the first one ever
heard in Viger. She was a slight, angular girl,
with a dark, thin face and black hair and eyes.
She looked like her father, and took after him
in many ways. Charles, the elder son, was like
his grandfather, tall and muscular, with a fine
head and a handsome face. He was studious
and read a great deal, and was always talking
to the curé about studying the law. Philippe
did not care about books; his father could
never keep him at school. He was short and
thick-set and had merry eyes, set deep in his
head. “Some one must learn to look after
things,” he said, and when his father died he
took sole charge of everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Desjardins were unsociable with others,
they were happy among themselves. Almost
every evening during the winter, when the work
was done, they would light up the front room
with candles, and Adèle would play on the
piano and sing. Charles would pace to and
fro behind her, and Philippe would thrust his
feet far under the stove, that projected from the
next room through the partition, and fall fast
asleep. Her songs were mostly old French
songs, and she could sing “Partant pour la
Syrie” and “La Marseillaise.” This last was a
favorite with Charles; he could not sing himself,
but he accompanied the music by making wild
movements with his arms, tramping heavily up
and down before the piano, and shouting out
so loudly as to wake Philippe, “Aux armes,
citoyens!” On fine summer evenings Philippe
and Adèle would walk up and down the road,
watching the marsh fire-flies, and pausing on
the bridge to hear the fish jump in the pool,
and the deep, vibrant croak of the distant frogs.
It was not always Philippe who walked there
with Adèle; he sometimes sat on the veranda
and watched her walk with some one else. He
would have waking dreams, as he smoked, that
the two figures moving before him were himself
and some one into whose eyes he was looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last it came to be reality for him, and
then he could not sit quietly and watch the
lovers; he would let his pipe go out, and
stride impatiently up and down the veranda.
And on Sunday afternoons he would harness his
horse, dress himself carefully, and drive off with
short laughs, and twinklings of the eyes, and
wavings of the hands. They were evidently
planning the future; and it seemed a distance
of vague happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles kept on his wonted way; if they
talked in the parlor, they could hear him stirring
upstairs; if they strolled in the road, they could
see his light in the window. Philippe humored
his studious habits; he only worked in the
mornings; in the afternoons he read, history
principally. His favorite study was the “Life
of Napoleon Buonaparte,” which seemed to
absorb him completely. He was growing more
retired and preoccupied every day,—lost in deep
reveries, swallowed of ambitious dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a somewhat longer day than
usual in the harvest-field, and it was late when
the last meal was ready. Philippe, as he called
Charles, from the foot of the stair, could hear
him walking up and down, seemingly reading
out loud, and when he received no response to
his demand he went up the stairs. Pushing
open the door, he saw his brother striding up
and down the room, with his hands clasped
behind him and his head bent, muttering to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charles!” He seemed to collect himself,
and looked up. “Come down to supper!”
They went downstairs together. Adèle and
Philippe kept up a conversation throughout the
meal, but Charles hardly spoke. Suddenly he
pushed his plate away and stood upright, to his
full height; a look of calm, severe dignity came
over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I!” said he; “I am the Great Napoleon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charles!” cried Adèle, “what is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prosperity of the nation depends upon
the execution of my plans. Go!” said he,
dismissing some imaginary person with an imperious
gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat as if stunned, and between them
stood this majestic figure with outstretched
hand. Then Charles turned away and commenced
to pace the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has come!” sobbed Adèle, as she sank
on her knees beside the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is only one thing to do,” said Philippe,
after some hours of silence. “It is hard;
but there is only one thing to do.” The room
was perfectly dark; he stood in the window,
where he had seen the light die out of the sky,
and now in the marshy field he saw the fireflies
gleam. He knew that Adèle was in the
dark somewhere beside him, for he could hear
her breathe. “We must cut ourselves off; we
must be the last of our race.” In those words,
which in after years were often on his lips, he
seemed to find some comfort, and he continued
to repeat them to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles lay in bed in a sort of stupor for
three days. On Sunday morning he rose. The
church bells were ringing. He met Philippe in
the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this Sunday?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here!” They went into the front
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is Sunday, you say. The last thing I remember
was you telling me to go in—that was
Wednesday. What has happened?” Philippe
dropped his head in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Philippe, what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must know, Philippe; where have I
been?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On Wednesday night,” said he, as if the
words were choking him, “you said, ‘I am the
Great Napoleon!’ Then you said something
about the nation, and you have not spoken
since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles dropped on his knees beside the table
against which Philippe was leaning. He hid
his face in his arms. Philippe, reaching across,
thrust his fingers into his brother’s brown hair.
The warm grasp came as an answer to all
Charles’s unasked questions; he knew that,
whatever might happen, his brother would guard
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a month or two he lay wavering between
two worlds; but when he saw the first snow,
and lost sight of the brown earth, he at once
commenced to order supplies, to write despatches,
and to make preparations for the
gigantic expedition which was to end in the
overthrow of the Emperor of all the Russias.
And the snow continues to bring him this
activity; during the summer, he is engaged,
with no very definite operations, in the field,
but when winter comes he always prepares for
the invasion of Russia. With the exception of
certain days of dejection and trouble, which
Adèle calls the Waterloo days, in the summer
he is triumphant with perpetual victory. On
a little bare hill, about a mile from the house,
from which you can get an extensive view of
the sloping country, he watches the movements
of the enemy. The blasts at the distant quarries
sound in his ears like the roar of guns. Beside
him the old gray horse, that Philippe has set
apart for his service, crops the grass or stands
for hours patiently. Down in the shallow valley
the Blanche runs, glistening; the mowers sway
and bend; on the horizon shafts of smoke
rise, little clouds break away from the masses
and drop their quiet shadows on the fields.
And through his glass Charles watches the
moving shadows, the shafts of smoke, and the
swaying mowers, watches the distant hills fringed
with beech-groves. He despatches his aides-de-camp
with important orders, or rides down
the slope to oversee the fording of the Blanche.
Half-frightened village boys hide in the long
grass to hear him go muttering by. In the
autumn he comes sadly up out of the valley,
leading his horse, the rein through his arm and
his hands in his coat-sleeves. The sleet dashes
against him, and the wind rushes and screams
around him, as he ascends the little knoll. But
whatever the weather, Philippe waits in the road
for him and helps him dismount. There is something
heroic in his short figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, my brother!” he says;—“Sire let us
go in!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the King of Rome better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Empress?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once has a gleam of light pierced these
mists. It was in the year when, as Adèle said,
he had had two Waterloos and had taken to his
bed in consequence. One evening Adèle brought
him a bowl of gruel. He stared like a child
awakened from sleep when she carried in the
lamp. She approached the bed, and he started
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adèle!” he said, hoarsely, and pulling her
face down, kissed her lips. For a moment she
had hope, but with the next week came winter;
and he commenced his annual preparations for
the invasion of Russia.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span><h1>THE WOOING OF MONSIEUR<br/> CUERRIER.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T had been one of those days that go
astray in the year, and carry the genius
of their own month into the alien ground of
another. This one had mistaken the last month
of spring for the last month of summer, and
had lighted a May day with an August sun.
The tender foliage of the trees threw almost
transparent shadows, and the leaves seemed
to burn with a green liquid fire in the windless
air. Toward noon the damp fields commenced
to exhale a moist haze that spread, gauze-like,
across the woods. Growing things seemed to
shrink from this heavy burden of sun, and if one
could have forgotten that there were yet trilliums
in the woods, he might have expected summer
sounds on the summer air. After the sun had
set the atmosphere hung dense, falling into
darkness without a movement, and when night
had come the sultry air was broken by flashes
of pale light, that played fitfully and without
direction. People sat on their door-steps for
air, or paced the walks languidly. It was not
a usual thing for Monsieur Cuerrier to go out
after nightfall; his shop was a general rendezvous,
and the news and the gossip of the neighborhood
came to him without his search. But
something had been troubling him all day, and
at last, when his evening mail was closed, he
put on his boots and went out. He sauntered
down the street in his shirt sleeves, with his
fingers in his vest pockets. His face did not
lose its gravity until he had seated himself
opposite his friend Alexis Girouard, and put a
pipe between his teeth. Then he looked over
the candle which stood between them, and
something gleamed in his eye; he nursed his
elbow and surveyed his friend. Alexis Girouard
was a small man, with brown side-whiskers;
his face was so round, and the movements of
his person so rapid, that he looked like a
squirrel whose cheeks are distended with nuts.
By occupation he was a buyer of butter and
eggs, and went about the country in a calash,
driving his bargains. This shrewd fellow, whom
no one could get the better of at trade, was
ruled by his maiden sister with a rod of iron.
He even enjoyed the friendship of Cuerrier by
sufferance; their interviews were carried on
almost clandestinely, with the figure of the
terrible Diana always imminent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a sufficient cloud of smoke was spread
around the room, Cuerrier asked, “Where is
she?” Alexis darted a glance in the direction
of the village, removing his pipe and pointing
to the same quarter; then he heaved a relieved
sigh, and commenced smoking again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are sure she’s out?” said Cuerrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexis looked uneasy. “No,” he answered,
“I can’t be sure she’s out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier burst into a hearty laugh. Alexis
stepped to the door and listened; when he
came back and sat down, Cuerrier said, without
looking at him, “Look here, Alexis, I’m
going to get married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His companion started so that he knocked
some of the ashes from his pipe, then with a
nervous jump he snatched the candle and went
into the kitchen. Cuerrier, left in the dark,
shook with silent laughter. Alexis came back
after making sure that Diana was not there,
and before seating himself he held the candle
close to his friend’s face and surveyed him
shrewdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, are you not mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alexis sat down, very much troubled in mind.
“You see I’m not young, and the mother is
getting old—see? Now, last week she fell
down into the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your getting married won’t prevent
her falling into the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that so much, Alexis, my good
friend, but if you had no one to look after
things—” here Alexis winced—“you would
perhaps think of it too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are old—how old?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier took his pipe from his mouth and
traced in the air what to Alexis’s eyes looked
like the figure fifty. Cuerrier offered him the
candle. “There is not a gray hair in my head.”
Girouard took the light and glanced down on his
friend’s shock of brown hair so finely disordered.
He sat down satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom now—tell me what charming
girl is to be the postmistress of Viger; is it the
Madame Laroque?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier broke again into one of his valiant
laughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess again,” he cried, “you are near it.
You’ll burn yourself next time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not the second cousin—not possible—not
Césarine Angers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier, grown more sober, had made various
signs of acquiescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what will your friend the widow say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Alexis, she’s—” he was going to
say something violent—“she’s one of the
troubles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! Who’s afraid of her! If you had
Diana to deal with, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Alexis, my good friend, that is it.
Could you not drop a little hint to the widow
some time? Something like this——” he was
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like a dumb man, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paufh! I have no way with the women, you
will make a little hint to the widow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then there was a sound of footsteps on
the walk. Alexis promptly blew out the candle,
grasped his friend by the arm, and hurried him
through the dark to the door. There he thrust
his hat into his hand, and saying in his ear,
“Good-night—good luck,” bolted the door
after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night had changed its mood. A gentle
breeze, laden with soft moisture, blew from the
dark woods; the mist was piled in a gray mass
along the horizon; and in spaces of sky as
delicately blue as blanched violets, small stars
flashed clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier pursed up his lips and whistled the
only tune he knew, one from “La Fille de
Madame Angot.” He was uneasy, too uneasy
to follow the intricacies of his tune, and he
stopped whistling. He had told his friend that he
was going to marry, and had mentioned the
lady’s name; but what right had he to do that?
“Old fool!” he said to himself. He remembered
his feuds with his love’s guardian, some of
them of years’ standing; he thought of his age,
he ran through the years he might expect to live,
and ended by calculating how much he was
worth, valuing his three farms in an instant. He
felt proud after that, and Césarine Angers did
not seem quite so far off. He resolved, just
before sleep caught him, to open the campaign
at once, with the help of Alexis Girouard; but
in the dream that followed he found himself
successfully wooing the widow, wooing her with
sneers and gibes, and rehearsals of the old
quarrels that seemed to draw her smilingly toward
him, as if there was some malign influence
at work translating his words into irresistible
phrases of endearment.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Cuerrier commenced to wear a gallant
blue waistcoat all dotted with white spots,
and a silk necktie with fringed ends. “You see
I am in the fashion now,” he explained to his
friends. Villeblanc, the superannuated hairdresser,
eyed him critically and commenced to
suspect him. He blew a whistle of gratification
when, one evening in mid-June, he saw the shy
Cuerrier drop a rose, full blown, at the feet of
Césarine Angers. His gratification was not
unmixed when he saw Césarine pick it up and
carry it away, blushing delicately. Cuerrier tried
to whistle “La Fille de Madame Angot,” but
his heart leaped into his throat, and his lips
curled into a nervous smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So—so!” said Villeblanc. “So—so!
I think I’ll curl my gentleman’s wig for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not unheedful of the beauty of
Césarine. He spoke a word of enigmatical
warning to the widow. “You had better put off
your weeds. Are we not going to have a
wedding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This seed fell upon ready ground, and bore
an unexpected shoot. From that day the
widow wore her best cap on week days. Then
along came the good friend, Alexis Girouard, with
his little hint. “My friend Cuerrier wants to
get married; he’s as shy as a bird, but don’t be
hard on him.” The plant blossomed at once.
The widow shook her finger at her image in the
glass, took on all the colors of the rainbow, and
dusted off a guitar of her youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier came in the evenings and sat awhile
with the widow, and that discreet second
cousin, hiding her withered rose. Sometimes
also with a stunted farmer from near Viger,
who wore shoe-packs and smelt of native tobacco
and oiled leather. This farmer was
designed by the widow for that rebel Césarine,
who still resisted behind her barricade, now
strengthened by secret supplies of roses from an
official of the government itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is high time to speak,” thought
Cuerrier, and one night, when there was not a
hint of native tobacco in the air, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame Laroque, I am thinking now of
what I would like to happen to me before I grow
an old man, and I think to be married would
be a good thing. If you make no objection,
I would marry the beautiful Césarine here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow gathered her bitter fruit. “Old
beast!” she cried, stamping on the guitar;
“old enough to be her great-grandfather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drove the bewildered postmaster out of
the house, and locked Césarine into her room.
She let her come down to work, but watched
her like a cat. Forty times a day she cried out,
“The old scoundrel!” and sometimes she
would break a silence with a laugh of high
mockery, that ended with the phrase, “The
idea!” that was like the knot to a whip-lash.
She even derided Cuerrier from her chamber
window if he dared to walk the street. The
postmaster bore it; he pursed up his lips to
whistle, and said, “Wait.” He also went to
see his friend Alexis. “I have a plan, Alexis,”
he said, “if Diana were only out of the road.”
But Diana was in the road, she was in league
with the widow. “Fancy!” she cried, fiercely,
“what is to become of us when old men behave
so. Why, the next thing I know, Alexis—<span class='it'>Alexis</span>
will want to get married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever Cuerrier’s plan was, he got no
chance to impart it. Diana was always in the
road, and reported everything to the widow;
she, in turn, watched Césarine. But one night,
when Alexis was supposed to be away, he
appeared suddenly in Cuerrier’s presence. He
had come back unexpectedly, and had not
gone home first. The plan was imparted to
him. “But to bring the calash out of the yard
at half-past twelve at night without Diana hearing,
never—never—she has ears like a watch-dog.”
But he pledged himself to try. The
widow saw him depart, and she and Diana expected
a <span class='it'>coup d’état</span>. Madame Laroque turned
the key on Césarine, and fed her on bread and
water; Diana locked her brother’s door every
night, when she knew he was in bed, much to
Alexis’s perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lane that separated the widow’s house
from Cuerrier’s was just nine feet wide. The
postmaster had reason to know that; Madame
Laroque had fought him for years, saying that
he had built on her land. At last they had
got a surveyor from the city, who measured it
with his chain. The widow flew at him. He
shrugged his shoulders. “The Almighty made
this nine feet,” he said, “you cannot turn the
world upside down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine feet,” said Cuerrier to himself, “nine
feet, and two are eleven.” With that length in
his head he walked over to the carpenter’s.
That evening he contemplated a two-inch plank
eleven feet long in his kitchen. The same
evening Alexis was deep in dissimulation. He
was holding up an image of garrulous innocence
to Diana, who glared at it suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postmaster bored a small hole through
the plank about two inches from one end,
through this he ran the end of a long rope and
knotted it firmly. Then he carried the plank
upstairs into a small room over the store.
Opposite the window of this room there was a
window in Madame Laroque’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, sweet dreams,” cried Alexis to
Diana, as, cold with excitement, he staggered
upstairs. He made all the movements of undressing,
but he did not undress; then he
gradually quieted down and sat shivering near
the window. In a short time Diana crept up
and locked his door. It took him an hour to
gain courage enough to throw his boots out of
the window; he followed them, slipping down
the post of the veranda. He crept cautiously
into the stable; his horse was ready harnessed
and he led her out, quaking lest she should
whinny. The calash was farther back in the
yard than usual; to drive out he would have to
pass Diana’s window. Just as he took the reins
in his hand the horse gave a loud, fretful neigh;
he struck her with the whip, but she would not
stir. He struck her again, and, as she bounded
past the window it was raised, and something
white appeared. Alexis, glancing over his
shoulder, gave a hoarse shout, to relieve his
excitement; he had seen the head of the chaste
Diana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cuerrier let down the top window-sash about
two inches, then he raised the lower sash almost
to its full height, and passed the end of the rope
from the outside through the upper aperture
into the room, and tied it to a nail. Then he
pushed the plank out of the window, and let it
drop until it swung by the rope; then he lifted
it up hand over hand till the end rested on the
sill. Adjusting it so as to leave a good four
inches to rest on the opposite ledge, he lowered
away his rope until the end of the plank reached
the opposite side, and there was a strong bridge
from Madame Laroque’s house to his own.
He took a stout pole and tapped gently on the
window. Césarine was stretched on her bed,
sleeping lightly. The tapping woke her; she
rose on her elbow; the sound came again;
she went to the window and raised a corner of
the curtain. Cuerrier flashed his lantern across
the glass. Césarine put up the window quietly.
She heard Cuerrier calling her assuringly. She
crept out on the plank, and put the window
down. Then she stood up, and, aided by the
stout pole, which the postmaster held firmly,
she was soon across the abyss. The plank was
pulled in, the window shut down, and all trace
of the exploit had vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sunrise, pausing after the ascent of a hill,
they looked back, and Césarine thought she
saw, like a little silver point in the rosy light,
the steeple of the far St. Joseph’s, and below
them, from a hollow filled with mist, concealing
the houses, rose the tower and dome of the
parish church of St. Valérie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week after, when the farmer from near
Viger came into the post-office for his mail, bearing
the familiar odor of native tobacco, the new
postmistress of Viger, setting the tips of her
fingers on the counter, and leaning on her
pretty wrists until four dimples appeared on the
back of each of her hands, said, “I have nothing
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rage of Madame Laroque was less than
her curiosity to know how Césarine had effected
her escape. She made friends with her, and
wore a cheerful face, but Césarine was silent.
“Tell her ‘birds fly,’ ” said Cuerrier. Exasperated,
at last, the widow commenced a petty
revenge. She cooked a favorite dinner of
Cuerrier’s, and left her kitchen windows open to
fill his house with the odor. But, early that morning,
the postmaster had gone off to St. Valérie
to draw up a lease, and had taken his wife with
him. About noon he had stopped to water his
horse, and had climbed out of his calash to
pluck some asters; Césarine decked her hat
with them, and sang a light song—she had
learned the air from “La Fille de Madame
Angot.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><h1>SEDAN.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>O</span>NE of the pleasantest streets in Viger was
that which led from the thoroughfare of
the village to the common. It was a little street
with little houses, but it looked as if only happy
people lived there. The enormous old willows
which shaded it through its whole length made
a perpetual shimmer of shadow and sun, and
towered so above the low cottages that they
seemed to have crept under the guardian trees
to rest and doze a while. There was something
idyllic about this contented spot; it
seemed to be removed from the rest of the
village, to be on the boundaries of Arcadia,
the first inlet to its pleasant, dreamy fields.
In the spring the boys made a veritable Arcadia
of it, coming there in bands, cutting the willows
for whistles, and entering into a blithe contest
for supremacy in making them, accompanying
their labors by a perpetual sounding of their
pleasant pipes, as if a colony of uncommon
birds had taken up their homes in the trees.
Even in the winter there was something pleasant
about it; the immense boles of the willows,
presiding over the collection of houses, seemed
to protect them, and the sunshine had always a
suggestion of warmth as it dwelt in the long
branches. It was on this street, just a little
distance from the corner, that Paul Arbique
kept his inn, which was famous in its way. He
called it The Turenne, after the renowned commander
of that name, for they had the same
birthplace, and Arbique himself had been a
soldier, as his medals would testify. The location
was favorable for such a house as Arbique
was prepared to keep, and in choosing it he
appealed to a crotchet in man which makes it
pleasanter for him to go around the corner for
anything he may require. A pleasant place it
was, particularly in summer. The very exterior
had an air about it, the green blinds and the green
slatted door, and the shadows from the willow-leaves
playing over the legend “Fresh Buttermilk,”
a sign dear to the lover of simple pleasures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From all the appearances one would have
supposed that The Turenne was a complete
success, and every one thought Arbique was
romancing when he said he was just getting
along, and that was all. But so far as he knew
he spoke the truth, for his wife managed
everything, including himself. There was only
one thing she could not do; she could not
make him stop drinking brandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Arbiques considered themselves very
much superior to the village people, because
they had come from old France. “I am a
Frenchman,” Paul would say, when he had
had too much brandy; but no one would take
offence at him, he was too good a fellow.
When he had had a modicum of his favorite
liquor he talked of his birthplace, Sedan, the
dearest spot on earth to him, and his Crimean
experiences; and when he had reached a stage
beyond that he talked of his wife. It was a
pathetic sight to see him at such times, as he
leaned close to his auditor, and explained to
him how superior a woman Felice was, and
what a cruel, inexplicable mistake she had made
in marrying him, and how all his efforts to
make her happy had failed, not through any
fault of her own, but because it was impossible
that he could ever make her happy; thus taking
all the blame of their domestic infelicity upon
his own shoulders, with the simple idea that it
must be his own fault when no fault of any
kind could possibly rest with Felice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a tall chivalrous-looking fellow, with
a military air, and despite his fifty years and
the extent of his potations there was yet a brave
flourish in his manner. He was seen at his
best on Sunday, when, clothed in a complete
suit of black, with a single carnation in his
buttonhole, and with an irreproachable silk
hat, he promenaded with Madame Arbique on
his arm. Madame on such occasions was as
fine as her lord, and held her silk gown far
above the defilement of the street, in order
to show her embroidered petticoat and a pair of
pretty feet. But no matter how finely she was
dressed she always wore an expression of discontent.
She had the instincts of a miser, but
she also had enough good sense not to let them
interfere with the sources of profit, and so,
although she was as keen to save a cent as any
one could have been, The Turenne showed no
sign of it. The provision for the entertainment
of guests was ample and sufficient. Felice
had always had her own way, and owing to
Paul’s incapacity, which had overtaken him
gradually, the affairs of the house had been
left in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had only had one child, who had
died when she was a baby, and this want of
children was a great trial to Paul. They
had attempted to fill her place by adopting
a little girl, but the experiment had not
been a success, and she grew to be something
between a servant and a poor relation working
for her board. This was owing to no fault of
Paul’s, who would have prevented it if he could,
but his wife had taken a dislike to the child,
and she simply neglected her. Latulipe, for in
the family she was called by no other name,
was a strange girl. She had been frightened
and subdued by Madame Arbique, and at times
she would scarcely speak a word, and then
again she would talk boldly and defiantly, as if
she were protesting, no matter how insignificant
her remarks might be. Her personal appearance
was as odd as her manner; she had an
abundance of hair, of a light, pleasant shade of
red, her complexion was a clear white, her lips
were intensely crimson, her dark eyes were
small but quick, and very clear. Her manner
was shy, and rather awkward. Her one claim
to distinction was that she had some influence
over Arbique, whom she could now and then
prevent drinking. He was sorry for her, and
ashamed of the position she occupied in the
house, which was so different from what he had
intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Franco-Prussian war broke out,
and for months before, The Turenne was the
rendezvous for those of the villagers who had
any desire to discuss the situation. Arbique
was the oracle of this group, and night after
night he held forth on the political situation, on
the art of war, and his personal experiences in
the army. There was only one habitué of The
Turenne who was silent on these occasions,
that was Hans Blumenthal, the German watchmaker.
He had had his corner in the bar-room
ever since he had come to Viger, and
was one of Arbique’s best customers. But
when the war excitement broke out Arbique
expected to see no more of him; the warmth
of the discussions and the violence of the
treatment his nation received nightly would
have been expected to drive him away. But
instead, he returned again and again to his place
at the little table by the window, peering through
his glasses with his imperturbable, self-absorbed
expression, not seeming to heed the wordy
storms that beset his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arbique, when hostilities had actually broken
out, pasted a map of the seat of war upon the
wall; above this he placed a colored picture of a
French chasseur, and scrawled below it the
words “<span class='it'>A Berlin!</span>” Even this did not disturb
the German. He took advantage of the map, and
as Arbique had set pins, to which were attached
red and blue pieces of wool, to show the positions
of the armies, he even studied the locations
and movements with interest. He read
his paper, gave his orders, paid his score, came
and went as he had always done. This made
Paul very angry, and he would have turned
him out of the house if he had not remembered
that he was his guest, and his sense of honor
would not permit it. He was drinking very
heavily and wanted to fight some one, but every
one agreed with him except the German, and
he kept silence. He had serious thoughts of
challenging him to a duel, if the opportunity
offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Latulipe was the only one who stood up for
Hans. She had been accustomed to wait
on the guests sometimes, when Arbique was
incapacitated, and his gentle manner had won
her regard. One day she turned on Paul, who
was abusing Hans behind his back, and gave him
a piece of her mind. She was so sudden and
sharp with it that she sobered him a little, and
in thinking it over he came to the conclusion
that if he could help it she would see the German
no more. Hans noticed her absence, and
said to Paul one night when he was ordering his
beer: “Where is Mademoiselle Latulipe?”
By the way he said it, in his odd French, any
one could have told what he thought of Latulipe.
“Mademoiselle Latulipe,” said Arbique, with a
dramatic flourish, “is my daughter.” So Hans
saw her no more in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had other trials besides this. Once in a
while the lads in the street hooted after him,
and this sort of attention became more frequent.
One evening, after the news of Woerth had been
received, some one threw a stone through the
window of his shop. That very night he stood
before the map with his hands behind him, peering
into it; as he altered the pins, which Arbique
had now lost all interest in, he heard some one
mutter “<span class='it'>Scélérat!</span>” He thought it must be
intended for him, but he drank his beer quietly
and went home rather early. After he had gone
some of his enemies, becoming valiant with
liquor, made a compact to go out when it was
late enough, break into his house, and give him
a sound beating. But Latulipe overheard their
plan from the stairway, and as soon as she could
get away without being noticed, she ran over to
the watchmaker’s shop. It was quite late and
there was not a soul on the street. She was
wondering how she could warn him, but when
she reached the door she noticed a ladder which
led to a scaffold running along below the windows
of the second story, where some workmen had
been making repairs. There was a light burning
in one of the second story windows, and without
waiting to reflect Latulipe ran up the ladder and
tapped at the window. Hans opened it, and
said something in German when he saw who it
was. Latulipe did not wait for salutations, but
told him exactly what he might expect. When
that was over she tried to escape as she had
come, but the darkness below frightened her,
and she could not go down the ladder. Hans
tried to coax her to come in at the window and
go out by the street door, but she would not
hear to that; she leaned against the house,
shrinking away from the edge. So Hans got
out upon the scaffolding. “Mademoiselle
Latulipe,” he said, in his rough French, “you
need not be alarmed at me; I have only a good
heart toward you.” He held out his hand, but
Latulipe knew by the sound of his voice that he
was going to make love to her, and before he
could say another word she was at the bottom
of the ladder. When the bravos came to give
Hans his beating he confronted them with a
lamp in one hand and a pistol in the other, and
they fell over one another in their haste to retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole of the month of August Arbique
had been wild with excitement; he could
think of nothing but the war, and would talk of
nothing else. At first he would not believe in any
reverse to the French arms; it was impossible—lies,
lies, everything was lies. His cry was “<span class='it'>A
Berlin!</span>” But although he could manage to
deceive himself by this false enthusiasm, sometimes
the truth would stab straight to his heart
like a knife, and he would tremble as if he had
the ague, for the honor of his country was the
thing dearest to him in all the world. If he
could only have died for her! But there, day
after day, he saw the pins on the map, moved
by that cold German, close around Metz. He
could no longer cry “<span class='it'>A Berlin</span>;” the French
army was facing Paris, with Berlin at its back.
He drank fiercely now, and even Latulipe could
do nothing with him. Madame Arbique knew
that he would drink himself to death, as his
father had done. He would sit and mutter by
the hour, thinking all the time of what revenge
he could have on Blumenthal, who had become
to his eyes the incarnation of hated Prussia.
But so long as Hans came to the house quietly
to sit at his table and drink his beer Arbique
would not say an uncivil word to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of the 28th of August there was
an unusual crowd at The Turenne, and a group
had surrounded the map gesticulating and discussing.
Hans had finished reading his paper,
and went toward them. They parted when they
saw him coming, and he stood peering down at
the map through his glasses. Arbique had not
been seen all evening, but he appeared suddenly,
looking haggard and shattered, and caught sight
of his friends grouped round the German. He
went slowly toward them, and as he approached
he heard Hans say: “There, there they must
fight,” and saw him put his finger on the map
between Mézières and Carignan, almost over
Sedan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had been in bed all day, and had not
had anything to drink, and when he saw the
German with his finger on Sedan he could not
stand it any longer. He broke out: “No, not
there—here,” his voice trembling with rage.
“Here they will fight—you for your abominable
Prussia, I for my beautiful France.” He
fell into a dramatic attitude. Drawing two pistols
from his pocket, he presented one to his
nearest friend to hand to Blumenthal. The man
held the pistol for a moment, but Hans never
moved. Madame Arbique, seeing the commotion,
and catching sight of the weapons, screamed
as loud as she could, and Latulipe, running in,
threw herself upon Arbique. He turned deadly
pale and had to use the girl’s strength to keep
from falling. Hans went away quietly, and sat
down near the window. Arbique was fluttering
like a leaf in the wind, and Latulipe and Felice
half carried him upstairs. The men left in the
room shook their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next evening Hans was walking in the
starlight, under the willows. With his dim
vision he saw some one leaning against one of
the trees, but when he passed again he knew it
was Latulipe. He stopped and spoke to her.
When she spoke she did not answer his question.
“Oh,” she said, “he will never get
better, never.” “Yes,” said Hans, “he will
be better.” “No,” said Latulipe, “I know
by the way he looks, and he says now that
France is beaten and crushed he does not want
to live.” “Brave soul!” said Hans. “And
when he goes,” said Latulipe, “what is to become
of me?” He laid his hand upon her
arm, and when she did not resist, he took her
hand in both his own. She was giving herself
to the enemy. A cloud above had taken the
starlight, and in the willows a little rain fell
with a timorous sound. Latulipe was crying
softly on Hans’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was September, and around Viger the
harvest was nearly finished. The days were
clear as glass; already the maples were stroked
with fire, with the lustre of wine and gold;
early risers felt the keener air; the sunsets
reddened the mists which lay light as lawn on
the low fields. But Paul Arbique thought and
spoke of Sedan alone, the place where he was
born, of the Meuse, the bridges, of his father’s
farm, just without the walls of the city, and of
his boyhood, and the friends of his youth. His
thoughts were hardly of the war, or of the terror
of the downfall which had a little while before
so haunted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the evening of the day upon which
the news of the battle had come. They had
resolved not to tell him, but there was something
in Latulipe’s manner which disturbed
him. Waking from a light doze, he said:
“That Prussian spy, what did he say?—they
must fight there—between Mézières and Carignan?
I have been at Carignan—and he
had his hound’s paw on Sedan.” He was
quiet for a while; then he said, dreamily:
“They—have—fought.” Latulipe, who was
watching with him, wept. In the night his
lips moved again. “France,” he murmured,
“France will rise—again.” It was toward the
morning of the next day when his true heart
failed. Latulipe had just opened the blinds.
A pale light came through the willows. When
she bent over him she caught his last word.
“Sedan.” He sighed. “Sedan.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span><h1>NO. 68 RUE ALFRED DE MUSSET.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T was an evening early in May. The maples
were covered with their little seed-pods,
like the crescents of the Moslem hosts they
hung redly in the evening air. The new leaf-tips
of the poplars shone out like silver blooms.
The mountain-ash-trees stood with their virginal
branches outlined against the filmy rose and
gray of the evening sky, their slender leaves
half open. Everything swam in the hazy light;
the air was full of gold motes; in the sky lay
a few strands of cloud, touched with almost
imperceptible rose. At the upper window of
a house in De Musset Street, Maurice Ruelle
looked down upon the trees covered with the
misty light. His window was high above everything,
and the house itself stood alone on the
brow of a little cliff that commanded miles of
broken country. Maurice was propped up at
the window, and had a shawl thrown about his
shoulders. The room was close; a little wood-fire
was dying away in the open stove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maurice, Maurice, I’m sick of life. I will
be an adventuress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maurice turned his head to look at the
speaker. She was seated on the floor, leaning
on her slanted arm, which was thrown behind
her to support her weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear sister, you are ambitious—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be bitter, Maurice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not bitter; I know you are ambitious;
I am proud of you, you know. I don’t see why
you have to nurse me; fate is cruel to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I don’t nurse you, you know that;
what’s my nursing good for? I only wish we
had money enough to send you away for these
terrible winters, or give you a room in some fine
hospital.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maurice watched the birds dropping through
the glow. A little maid brought in candles.
Eloise began to walk up and down the room
restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, well, we haven’t the money,” Maurice
sighed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money—money—it’s not altogether a matter
of money; to me it’s a matter of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, to me it’s hardly a matter of money
or of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maurice, you must not think of that; I forbid
it. I must do something. I feel that I
can succeed. Look at me, Maurice—tell me
now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood with her head thrown back; and
poised lightly, and with a little frown on her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Superb!” said her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I’ll do something desperate,” she
said. “I must live; I was made to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear, that is the difference between
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maurice, how dare you; I forbid it; I
have decided. You will go south, and I will
begin to live. I am going to stop wishing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have long ago ceased to wish; wishing
was the only passion I ever had; I have
given it up. But I have not wished for money;
sometimes I have wished for health—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not finish his sentence; he only
thought of what he had longed for more than
anything else, the love of his beautiful, impulsive
sister. Eloise was dusting her geranium
leaves. Maurice looked from his window into
the tree on which the leaves were not yet thick
enough to hide the old nests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short time after this a rather curious advertisement
appeared in one of the city papers.
It read: “Very handsome old oak furniture.
Secretaire with small drawers. A dower chest
and a little table. Each article richly carved.
For particulars call at No. 68 Rue Alfred de
Musset, Viger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eloise read this advertisement to her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does this mean?” he asked. “We
have no such furniture, but it is our number
true enough. Is this the commencement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear, that is what it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day callers in response to this
advertisement began to arrive. Eloise answered
the bell herself. The first was a rather shabby
old man who wore a tall hat and green glasses.
He produced a crumpled clipping from the
paper, and, smoothing it out, handed it to Eloise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come to buy this second-hand furniture,”
he explained, holding his hat by the
brim. Eloise looked at the advertisement as if
she had never seen it before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be some mistake,” she said. “I
have no such furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not mistaken the number—No. 68
Rue Alfred de Musset.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but the printer must have made a mistake;
this is not the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many times that day she had to give unpromising
looking people the same answer. Every
one of them accepted the situation cheerfully;
certainly it must have been a mistake. Three
letters came also with inquiries about the furniture.
One of these Eloise was tempted to answer;
but she resolved to wait a day or two.
The next day no one came at all; but on the
next, about four o’clock in the afternoon, a young
man drove up in a dog-cart. He left his horse,
and walked rapidly through the little garden to
the house. He was a handsome vigorous-looking
youth. He rang somewhat violently; and
Eloise answered the summons. She opened
the door a foot, and the caller could only see a
bit of her white dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have called to see the furniture you have
advertised,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened slowly, and, taking this as
an invitation to enter, he stepped into the hall.
He could not tell why, but he expected to see
an old woman behind the door; instead he saw
a very graceful girl holding the door-knob between
her fingers. Without a word she preceded
him with an air of shyness, and led the way into
the front room. He glanced about for the
furniture; it was evidently not there. She
asked him to be seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father wanted me to come out and look
at the things you advertised,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very good, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all; my father picks up these things
for the house, when they are really valuable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are very valuable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She still wore an air of shyness, and looked
abstractedly from the window into a lilac-bush;
she seemed nervous and apprehensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you let me see them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a noise upstairs. Eloise half
started from her chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg of you not to speak so loudly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He relapsed into a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon, I was not conscious of speaking
too loudly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that, but—I cannot explain.”
She ended abruptly. “You see,” she said, hesitatingly,
“I wish you had come yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you promised them to some one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not at all; but yesterday it might have
been possible, to-day it is impossible to show it
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can I see it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am unfortunate—I cannot say when. It
is my brother’s—but it must be sold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An expression of slight distress crossed her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he not want it sold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur, I beg of you not to question me;
I am in great perplexity.” She continued, after
a moment’s pause, “You have rarely seen things
so exquisite; the secretaire has a secret cabinet,
the chest is carved with a scene of nymphs
in a wood; the table is a beautiful little table.”
She figured these articles in the air with an
imaginative wave of her hand. The young man
began to regard her with some interest; he
remarked to himself that she was a lovely girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry my call is inopportune, I will
come again.” He left his card on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps when you come again it will be
more convenient,” she said, following him at
some distance to the door. He opened it himself,
and went down the steps; as he looked
back it was slowly shutting, and he caught a
glimpse of her delicate white dress as it closed.
Eloise took up the card. The name was Pierre
Pechito. She knew the name; it was borne
by one of the richest of the city merchants.
She took the card up to Maurice. He held it
in his emaciated fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the end of Chapter One?” he
asked. “Well, he may never come back; and
what will you do with him if he does come
back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he will come; as for the rest, we must
succeed. But there is one thing, Maurice, you
must be the invisible ogre; you must rage
about here as wildly as you can, while I am
working out our destiny downstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My destiny?” he asked, with a falling
touch of sadness in his accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days after this Pierre returned. “May
I come in?” he asked, as Eloise held the door
open hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you wish, Monsieur.” They sat a moment
silently in the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur,” said Eloise, commencing hurriedly
but determinedly, “in this life everything
is uncertain; so much depends upon mere circumstances,
which are too obscure for us to
control. I am willing to show you the furniture,
but how much depends upon that!” She
rose with the air of a heroine, and led the way
to the foot of the stairs. Pierre followed. She
had ascended three steps, and he had his hand
on the newel post, when there was a crash in
the room above. Eloise turned suddenly and
leaned against the banister, glancing up the
stairs, and extending her hand to keep Pierre
back. “Monsieur, for the love of heaven do
not come on, go back—go back into the room,
I beg of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am leaving you in danger, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am accustomed to it. I beg of you.”
She accompanied these words with an imploring
gesture. Pierre went into the room, where
he paced up and down. The noise increased
in violence, and then ceased altogether. Eloise
returned to the room; she leaned from the
window, breathing convulsively; she plucked
one of the half-grown lilac leaves and bit it
through and through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet the furniture must be sold,” she said
aloud. Pierre took a step toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, you are in distress. May I
not help you? I am able to. You can command
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, Monsieur, you mean I can command
your wealth.” Pierre was profoundly moved at
the sorrow in her girlish voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean I would help you; I want to do
what I can for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go no farther,” she said, with her
eyes fixed on the floor. “I must not come
into your happy life.” There was a trace of
bitterness in her tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have undertaken to buy the furniture,” he
said, with a smile. “I will not give up so soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maurice, Maurice, you are a splendid ogre!”
said Eloise, throwing open the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is terribly exhausting,” he said, with a
faint smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Pierre next came it was raining quietly
through a silver haze; the little maid opened
the door; a moment later Eloise came into the
room. When she spoke her voice sounded
restrained; and to Pierre she seemed completely
different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have deceived you,” she commenced,
without prelude, “there is no furniture to sell.”
To all his questions or remonstrances she gave
him this answer, as if she were afraid to trust
herself to other words, standing with her eyes
cast to the floor, and an expressionless face.
But when she seemed the most distant, as if
she could not recede further, she burst into
tears. Pierre hurried toward her—“Mademoiselle,
I cannot address you by name; you
cannot deceive me; you are in great distress.
I beg you not to think of the furniture; it is
not necessary that these things of wood should
trouble you further; to-day I did not come to
see it, I came to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Monsieur,” she sobbed, “you must
never come here again, never—never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make no mistake, I will come, at least
until I can help you, until I know your story.”
He gained her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur, I cannot accept your assistance;
but your kindness demands my story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told it. She was a lovely girl caught in
a net of circumstances. She was an orphan.
Her parents had left her and her brother a
little money—too little to live on—they
existed. Her brother was a cripple—how
often had she wished she was dead—he was
wicked. She hinted at unkindness, at tyranny.
It was necessary to sell these heir-looms.
(Here Pierre pressed her hand, “You could
not deceive me,” he said.) But he would not
hear of it. Her life was intolerable—but she
must live it to the end—to the end. “If I
could have deceived you, Monsieur, I would
have done so.” A smile shimmered through
her tears. Pierre pressed her hand; she softly
drew it away. Suddenly there was a crash in
the room above; a light shower of dry white-wash
was thrown down around them; the
sound of an inhuman voice came feebly down
the stairs. “I must go, do not detain me,”
she cried, as Pierre tried to intercept her. He
endeavored to hold her at the foot of the
stairs. “Do not go, I beg of you.” She
turned sweetly toward him. “I must go; it is
my duty; you do yours.” The tears were not
yet dry on her eyelids. Pierre watched her
flutter upstairs like a dove flying into a hawk’s
nest. His pulses were pounding at his wrists.
“I wish I knew what my duty was,” he said to
himself. As he left the house he glanced up at
the window, a handkerchief dropped down; he
pressed it to his lips and thrust it into his
bosom. When he was out of sight he examined
it. It was a dainty thing of the most delicate
fabric; in one corner were the words, “Eloise
Ruelle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eloise found Maurice almost fainting with
his exertion. When he recovered, he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the game worth the candle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we will see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eloise, you have been crying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cry easily, I do everything easily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maurice turned away and gazed from the
window. The rain was so fine it seemed to be
a rising mist; the trees were hidden, like plants
in the bottom of the sea; somewhere the sun
was shining, for there was a silver bar in the
mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre was not slow in coming again; but,
instead of seeing Eloise, he had a note thrust
into his hand by the little serving-maid. It
ran: “I cannot see you. <span class='it'>He</span> forbids it. Who
could have told that our last word was
‘good-by.’ If I could have spoken again I
would have thanked you. How can I ever do
so now? Adieu.” Reading this on the step,
he scrawled hurriedly on a leaf of his note-book:
“I would not have you thank me, but I must
see you again. Your risk is great, but I will be
here to-morrow night; we will have the darkness,
and all I ask is ten minutes. Is it too
much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the note to the maid, who shut the
door. The house looked absolutely sphinx-like
as he walked away from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night was moist with a touch of
frost. A little smoke from burning leaves hung
in the air with a pungent odor. The scent of the
lilacs fell with the wind when it moved. Eloise
was muffled picturesquely in a cloak. Pierre
was holding her hand, which she had not
reclaimed. “I have dared everything to
come,” she said softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are brave, braver than I was to ask
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know my story. You are the only
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That binds us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I thank you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not try, I have done nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a burning brand was hurled from the
window; it fell into the lilac-tree where it devoured
a cone of blossom and withered the leaves
around it. It threw up a little springing flame
which danced a light on Eloise, who had cowered
into a corner by the steps, with her hand
over her eyes. Pierre went to her. “Tell
me,” he said, “what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” she moaned, “he suspects we are here;
he always has a fire on the hottest nights, and
he is throwing the sticks out.” This led Pierre
to expect another one. He caught her by the
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must come out of danger,” he said,
“one might fall on your dress.” The brand
was glowing in spots. He tore it out of the
bush and trampled on it. They went to the
other side of the steps. It was the season of
quick growth. In one day thousands of violets
had lit their little tips of yellow fire in the tangle
of the underwood; in one day the tulips were
moulded into fragile cups of flame burning
steady in the sunlight; in one day the lilacs
had burst their little clove-like blooms, and
were crowding in the dark-green leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre was saying excitedly: “Listen to me.
This thing cannot go further. I love you, I
am yours. I must protect you. You cannot
deny me.” Eloise tried to stop him with an
imploring gesture. “No,” he cried, “you must
hear me! you must be mine! I will take you
away from here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do not tempt me!” cried Eloise. “I
must stay here. I cannot leave him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must leave him. What hold has he
upon you? I will never let you go back to this
torment,—never. Eloise,” he continued seriously,
“sometimes we have to decide in a
moment the things of a life-time. This is such
a moment. Before I pluck this blossom,” he
said, leaning down to a dwarf lilac-bush bearing
one bloom, “I want you to promise to be my
wife.” A moment later he had plucked the
flower, but had dropped it, and had caught
Eloise in his arms. She stifled a cry, and gave
herself to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maurice, Maurice,” cried Eloise, “look at
me, I am triumphant!” He hardly looked at
her; he was cowering over the fire, which had
smouldered away, and in which the ashes were
fluttering about like moths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have done what you asked, that is all,”
he said, with an effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is everything to me; I will never forget
you, Maurice, no matter how powerful I may
become.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! you need not remember me for long.
Perhaps I will have what I wanted here, in
some other star.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A few evenings later Eloise drew the door
after her: “Hush!” she said, “the least noise
will disturb him.” She hesitated, and left the
door ajar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you regret?” whispered Pierre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but I am leaving everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, even the old furniture; if it had not
been for that I would never have known you,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything—everything,” murmured Eloise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened for a moment, and then shut the
door softly on the empty house: Maurice had
gone to the hospital that afternoon; the little
maid had been discharged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” she said, holding Pierre’s arm and
leaning away from him with her sweet smile,
“I have also gained all—everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next moment they had gone cautiously
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the beginning of her career.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span><h1>THE BOBOLINK.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>I</span>T was the sunniest corner in Viger where old
Garnaud had built his cabin,—his cabin,
for it could not be called a house. It was only
of one story, with a kitchen behind, and a
workshop in front, where Etienne Garnaud
mended the shoes of Viger. He had lived there
by himself ever since he came from St. Valérie;
every one knew his story, every one liked him.
A merry heart had the old shoemaker; it made
a merry heart to see him bending his white
head with its beautiful features above his homely
work, and to hear his voice in a high cadence
of good-humored song. The broad window of
his cabin was covered with a shutter hinged at
the top, which was propped up by a stick
slanted from the window-sill. In the summer
the sash was removed, and through the opening
came the even sound of the Blanche against the
bridge piers, or the scythe-whetting from some
hidden meadow. From it there was a view of
a little pool of the stream where the perch
jumped clear into the sun, and where a birch
growing on the bank threw a silver shadow-bridge
from side to side. Farther up, too, were
the willows that wore the yellow tassels in the
spring, and the hollow where burr-marigolds
were brown-golden in August. On the hill
slope stood a delicate maple that reddened the
moment summer had gone, which old Etienne
watched with a sigh and a shake of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the old man was a favorite with the elder
people of Viger, he was a yet greater favorite
with the children. No small portion of his
earnings went toward the purchase of sugar
candy for their consumption. On summer afternoons
he would lay out a row of sweet lumps on
his window-sill and pretend to be absorbed by
his work, as the children, with much suppressed
laughter, darted around the corner of his cabin,
bearing away the spoils. He would pause every
now and then to call, “Aha—Aha! Where
are all my sweeties? those mice and rats must
have been after them again!” and would
chuckle to himself to hear the children trying
to keep back the laughter, out of sight around
the corner. In the winter, when the boys and
girls would come in to see him work, he always
managed to drop some candy into their pockets,
which they would find afterward with less surprise
than the old man imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his great friend was the little blind
daughter of his neighbor Moreau. “Here
comes my little fairy,” he would call out, as he
saw her feeling her way down the road with her
little cedar wand. “Here comes my little
fairy,” and he would go out to guide her across
the one plank thrown over the ditch in front of
his cabin. Then they would sit and chat together,
this beautiful old man and the beautiful
little girl. She raised her soft brown, sightless
eyes to the sound of his voice, and he told her
long romances, described the things that lay
around them, or strove to answer her questions.
This was his hardest task, and he often failed
in it; her questions ran beyond his power, and
left him mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One spring he bought a bobolink from some
boys who had trapped it; and he hung its cage
in the sun outside his cabin. There it would sing
or be silent for days at a time. Little Blanche
would sit outside under the shade of the shutter,
leaning half into the room to hear the old man
talk, but keeping half in the air to hear the
bird sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They called him “Jack” by mutual consent,
and he absorbed a great deal of their attention.
Blanche had to be present at every cage cleaning.
One day she said, “Uncle Garnaud, what
is he like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, dearie, he’s a beauty; he’s black all
over, except his wings and tail, and they have
white on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what are his wings like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, now, that finishes me. I am an old
fool, or I could tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Garnaud, I never even felt a bird;
could I feel Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I could catch him; but you mustn’t
squeeze him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack was caught with a sudden dart of the
old man’s hand; the little blind girl felt him
softly, traced the shape of his outstretched wing,
and put him back into the cage with a sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Uncle Garnaud,” she asked, “how
did they catch him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, they put a little cage on a
stump in the oat-field, and by-and-by the bird
flew over and went in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, didn’t he know they would not let
him out if he once went in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you know, he hadn’t any old uncle
to tell him so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but birds must have uncles, if they
have fathers just like we have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Etienne puckered up his eyes and put
his awl through his hair. The bird ran down
a whole cadence, as if he was on the wind over
a wheat-field; then he stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Uncle Garnaud, I know he must
mean something by that. What did he do all
day before he was caught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think he did any work. He just
flew about and sang all day, and picked up
seeds, and sang, and tried to balance himself
on the wheat-ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He sang all day? Well, he doesn’t do
that now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird seemed to recall a sunny field-corner,
for his interlude was as light as thistledown,
and after a pause he made two little
sounds like the ringing of bells at Titania’s
girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps he doesn’t like to be shut up and
have nobody but us,” she said, after a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the old man, hesitatingly, “we
might let him go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” faltered the child, “we might let him
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next time little Blanche was there she
said, “And he didn’t do anything but that,
just sing and fly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I think not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, he could fly miles and miles,
and never come back, if he didn’t want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes; he went away every winter, so
that the frost wouldn’t bite him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Uncle Garnaud, he didn’t, did he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, true, he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl was silent for a while; when
the old man looked at her the tears were in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my pretty, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I was just thinking that why he didn’t
sing was because he only saw you and me, and
the road, and our trees, when he used to have
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the old man, stopping his work,
“he might have everything again, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might he?” she asked, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we might let him fly away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird dropped a clear note or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Uncle Garnaud, do let him go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, beauty, just as you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man put off his apron and took the
cage down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, little girl, you hold the cage, and
we’ll go where he can fly free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blanche carried the cage and he took her
hand. They walked down to the bridge, and
set the cage on the rail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, dearie, open the door,” said the old
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little child felt for the slide and pushed
it back. In a moment the bird rushed out and
flew madly off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone,” she said, “Jack’s gone.
Where did he go, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He flew right through that maple-tree, and
now he’s over the fields, and now he’s out of
sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And didn’t he even once look back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, never once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood there together for a moment, the
old man gazing after the departed bird, the
little girl setting her brown, sightless eyes on
the invisible distance. Then, taking the empty
cage, they went back to the cabin. From that
day their friendship was not untinged by regret;
some delicate mist of sorrow seemed to have
blurred the glass of memory. Though he could
not tell why, old Etienne that evening felt anew
his loneliness, as he watched a long sunset of
red and gold that lingered after the footsteps
of the August day, and cast a great color into
his silent cabin above the Blanche.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span><h1>THE TRAGEDY OF THE SEIGNIORY.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>T</span>HERE was a house on the outskirts of
Viger called, by courtesy, the Seigniory.
Passing down one of the side-streets you caught
sight of it, set upon a rise, having nothing to do
with the street, or seemingly with any part of the
town. Built into the bank, as it was, the front
had three stories, while the back had but two.
The lower flat, half cellar, half kitchen, was
lighted from a broad door and two windows
facing the southeast. Entrance to the second
floor was had by a flight of steps to a wide
gallery running completely across the front of
the house. Then, above this second story,
there was a sharply-peaked roof, with dormer-windows.
The walls of the kitchen story were
rough stone, while the upper part had been plastered
and overlaid with a buff-colored wash;
but time had cracked off the plaster in many
places, and showed the solid stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all the ravages of time upon it, and
with all its old surroundings gone, it yet had an
air of some distinction. With its shoulder to
the street, and its independent solidity, it made
men remember days gone by, when it was only
a farm-house on the Estate of the Rioux family.
Yet of that estate this old house, with its surrounding
three acres of land, was all that remained;
and of the retainers that once held
allegiance to this proud name, Louis Bois was
the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Living alone in the old house, growing old
with it, guarding some secret and keeping at a
proper distance the inquisitive and loquacious
villagers, had given Louis also some distinction.
He was reported an old soldier, and bore about
the witness of it in a wooden leg. He swore,
when angry, in a cavalier fashion, using the
heavier English oaths with some freedom. His
bravery, having never been put to proof, rested
securely upon these foundations. But he had
a more definite charm for the villagers; he was
supposed to have money of his own, and
afforded the charming spectacle of a human
being vegetating like a plant, without effort and
without trouble. Louis Bois had grown large
in his indolence, and towards the end of his
career he moved with less frequency and
greater difficulty. His face was round and fat;
the hair had never grown on it, and the skin
was fine and smooth as an orange, without
wrinkles, but marked with very decided pores.
The expression of amiability that his mouth
promised was destroyed by an eye of suspicious
restlessness. About fifteen years before the
time of his release Louis had been sworn to his
post by the last of the Rioux family—Hugo
Armand Theophile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This young man, of high spirit and passionate
courage, found himself, at the age of twenty-five,
after two years of intermittent study at a Jesuit
College, fatherless, and without a sou to call
his own. Of the family estate, the farm-house,
round which Viger had closed, was all that
remained, and from its windows this fiery youth
might look across the ten acres that were his,
over miles of hill and wood to which his grandfather
had been born. This vista tortured him
for three days, when he sold seven of his acres,
keeping the rest from pride. Then he shook
off the dust of Viger, but not before swearing
Louis Bois, who was old enough to be his
father, and loved him as such, to stay and
watch the forlorn hope of the Rioux Estate
until he, the last of the line, should return and
redeem his ancient heritage. He would be
gone ten years, he said; and Louis reflected
with pride that his own money would keep him
that long, and longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first he kept the whole house open, and
entertained some of his friends; but he soon
discovered that he lost money by that, and
gradually he boarded up the windows and lived
in the kitchen and one room of the upper flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a sensitive being, this, and his master’s
idea had taken hold upon him. His burly
frame contained a faint heart; he had no physical
courage; and he was as suspicious as a
savage. Moreover, he was superstitious, as
superstitious as an old wife, and odd occurrences
made him uneasy. If he could have
been allowed to doze on his gallery in the sun
all his days, and sleep secure of dreams and
visitations all his nights, his life might have
been bearable. The first three years of his
stewardship were comparatively uneventful.
He traced his liege’s progress through the
civilized world by the post-mark on his letters,
which sometimes contained a bill of exchange,
of which the great and safe bank of Bardé
Brothers took charge. As yet his master had
not captured a treasure ship; but seven years
remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of his fourth year something
happened which disturbed Louis’ existence to
its centre. An emissary of the devil, in the
guise of a surveyor, planted his theodolite, and
ran a roadway which took off a corner of his
three acres, and for this he received only an
arbitrator’s allowance. In vain he stumped up
and down his gallery, and in vain his English
oaths—the roadway went through. To add
to his trouble, the letters from the wanderer
ceased. Was he dead? Had he forgotten?
No more money was coming in, and Louis had
the perpetual sight of the alienated lands before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, when he was coming home from
the bank, his eye caught a poster that made
him think; it was an announcement of a famous
lottery. Do what he would he could not get it
out of his head; and that evening, when he was
cooking his supper, he resolved to make money
after a fashion of his own. He saw himself a
suddenly rich man, the winner of the seventy-five-thousand-dollar
prize. He felt his knee
burn under him, and felt also what a dead
thing his wooden leg was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to venture small sums in the lottery,
hoarding half his monthly allowance until
he should have sufficient funds to purchase a
ticket. Waiting for the moment when he could
buy, and then waiting for the moment when he
could receive news of the drawing, lent a feverish
interest to his life. But he failed to win.
With his failure grew a sort of exasperation—he
would win, he said, if he spent every cent he
owned. He had moments when he suspected
that he was being duped, but he was always
reassured upon spelling out the lottery circular,
where the drawing by the two orphan children
was so touchingly described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, after repeated failures, he drew every
cent of his own that he could muster, and
bought a whole ticket. He never rested a
moment until the returns came. He had days
of high spirits, when he touched his gains and
saw them heaped before him, and other days of
depression when he cursed his ill luck, and saw
blanks written everywhere. When he learned
the result his last disappointment was his greatest.
He had drawn a blank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in a perfect fury of rage, and went off
to bed cursing like a sea-pirate. When he took
off his wooden leg, he took it by the foot and
beat the floor with the knee-end until he got
some relief. Could he have captured, he would
have murdered the innocent orphan children.
He swore never to be tempted again, but the
morning when he took that oath, April was
bleak on the hills, and a tardy spring circled in
cold sunshine, leaving the buds suspended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When May came, his hope again blossomed.
Slowly and certainly his mind approached that
money he had in trust for his master, until, one
sultry day in June, he saw his way to success,
and felt his conscience lulled. That afternoon
he dozed on the gallery and dreamed. He felt
he was in Heaven, and the heaven of his dreams
was a large Cathedral whose nave he had
walked somewhere in his journeyings. He saw
the solemn passages, the penetrating shafts of
light, the obscure altar rising dimly in the star-hung
alcove; and from the glamour round the
altar floated down a magnificent angel, and with
a look of perfect knowledge in his eyes shamed
him for his base resolve. Slowly, as Louis
quailed before him, he dwindled, shimmering
in the glory shaken from his vesture, until he
grew very faint and indistinct, and dissolved
slowly into light. Then his vision swayed
aside, and he saw his own gallery, and a little
cream-colored dog, that sat with his back half-turned
towards him, eying him over his shoulder.
Superstitious Louis shuddered when he
saw this dog. He thought there was something
uncanny about him; but to a casual observer
he was an ordinary dog of mixed blood. He
had a sharp nose and ears, piercing eyes,
straight, cream-colored hair rather white upon
the breast, and a tail curled down upon his
back. He was a small dog; an intense nervousness
animated his every movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis was afraid to drive him away, and so
long as he saw him he could not forget his
dream and the reproof he had had from heaven;
gradually he came to believe the animal was a
spirit in canine form. His reasons for this
were that the dog never slept, or at least never
seemed to sleep. All day long he followed Louis
about. If he dozed in his chair the dog laid
his nose between his paws and watched him.
If he woke at night his eyes burned in the
darkness. Again, he never seemed to eat anything,
and he was never heard to utter a sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis, half-afraid of him, gave him a name;
he called him Fidele. He also tried to coax
him, but to no purpose. The dog never
approached him except when he went to sleep;
then he would move nearer to him. At last he
got greater confidence; and Louis awoke from a
doze one day to find him gnawing his wooden
leg. He tried to frighten him off; but Fidele
had acquired the habit and stuck to it. Whenever
Louis would fall asleep, Fidele would
approach him softly and chew his leg. Perhaps
it was the soft tremor that was imparted to his
fleshy leg from the gnawing of the wooden one;
but Louis never slept more soundly than when
this was progressing. He saw, however, with
dismay, his hickory support vanishing, and to
avoid wasting his money on wooden legs he
covered the one he had with brass-headed
tacks. In the end the dog came to be a
sort of conscience for him. He could never
look at his piercing eyes without thinking of the
way he had been warned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To pay for his recklessness Louis had to live
on a pittance for years; just enough to keep
himself alive. He might have lost his taste for
gambling, through this rigor, and his temptation
to use his master’s money might never have
returned; but in his lottery business he had
made a confidant of one of the messengers of
the Bardé Bank. The fellow’s name was
Jacques Potvin. He was full of dissimulation;
he loved a lie for its own sake; he devoured
the simple character of Louis Bois. Whenever
they met, Louis was treated to a flushed account
of all sorts of escapades,—thousands made in a
night—tens of thousands by a pen-stroke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, as a crowning success, Jacques Potvin
himself had won a thousand dollars in a drawing
that Louis could not participate in. This
was galling. To have that money lying idle;
never to hear from his master Rioux, who was
probably dead, and to see chance after chance
slip by him. He gave his trouble to Potvin!
Potvin took the weight lightly and threw it
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” he said. “If I had that money
under my fingers, I would be a rich man before
the year was out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fever was in Louis’ blood again. He
tossed a sleepless night, and then resolved
desperately. He shut Fidele up in the attic,
and went off and bought a ticket with his
master’s money. When he came back from the
bank, the first thing he saw was Fidele seated
in one of the dormer-windows, watching him.
It would be six months before he could get any
news of his venture; six months of Fidele and
an accusing conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half the time was scarcely over when, to his
horror and joy, came a letter from his master.
It was dated at Rio. He was on his way
home; he would arrive in about six months.
The probable failure of his scheme gave Louis
agony now. He would have to face his master,
who would arrive at Christmas if his plans were
discharged, with a rifled bank account. On
the other hand, if he should be successful!—Oh!
that gold, how it haunted him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One night, on the eve of his expectation,
Louis fell asleep as he was cooking his supper.
He slept long, and when he awoke his stove
was red-hot. He started up, staring at something
figured on the red stove door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only the number of the stove, but
it was also the number of his ticket. He
waited, after that, in perfect serenity, and
when his notice came he opened it with calmness.
He had won the seventy-five-thousand-dollar
prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went off hot foot to Potvin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he said, “I’ll have them send
it to the Bardé Bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just keep cool,” said Potvin. “Of course
you’ll do nothing of the sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Wait and see. The Imperial Bank
is safe enough for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis had the money sent to the Imperial
Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A short time after this, when Louis passed
the Bardé Bank, a crowd of people were besieging
the doors and reading the placards; the
Bank had suspended payment. The shrewdness
of Potvin had saved his seventy-five
thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he next met Jacques, he hugged him to
his heart. Jacques laid his finger on his nose:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deeper still,” he said. “I know, I <span class='it'>know</span>
that the Imperial itself is totterish. This affair
of the Bardés has made things shaky; see?
Everything is on three legs. If I were you,
now; if <span class='it'>I</span> were you, I’d just draw that seventy-five
thousand dollars and lay it away in a strong-box
till this blows over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Louis, in a panic, “I have no
strong-box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>I</span> have,” said Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis laid his hands on his shoulders, and
could have wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas passed, but no sign of Hugo
Armand Theophile. But the second week in
January brought a letter, two days old, from
New York. Rioux would be in Viger in a week
at the latest. Louis was in great spirits. He
planned a surprise for his master. He went off
to find Jacques Potvin, but Jacques was not
to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis arranged that Jacques was to meet
him at a tavern called “The Blue Bells” the
next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Jacques, when they met, “this is
absurd. What do you want the money for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, I want it, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But think; seventy-five thousand dollars!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want it for a few days. Just the money—myself—I—is
it not mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one in the next compartment rose, and
put his ear to the partition. The voices were
low, but he could hear them well. Listening
intently, his eyes seemed to sink into his head,
and burn there darkly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, so it is,” concluded Jacques. “I will
get it for you. But we’ll have to do the thing
quietly, very quietly. I’ll drive out to Viger
to-morrow night, say. I’ll meet you at that
vacant field next the church, at eleven, and the
money will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The listener in the next compartment withdrew
hastily, and mingled with the crowd at
the bar. That night he wandered out to Viger.
He observed the church and the vacant lot,
and saw that there were here and there hollows
under the sidewalk, where a man might crouch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He afterward wandered about for a while,
and found himself in front of the old farm-house.
A side window of the second story was
filled with the flicker of a fire. A ladder leaned
against the wall and ran up past the window.
He hesitated whether to ascend the gallery-steps
or the ladder. He chose the ladder.
With his foot on the lowest rung, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I hadn’t this little scheme on hand I
would go in, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went up the ladder and looked in at the
window. Louis Bois was asleep before the fire.
Fidele lay by his side. The man caught the
dog’s eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis woke nervously, and saw a figure at the
window. The only thing he discerned distinctly
was a white sort of cap. In his sudden
fear, seeking something to throw, he touched
Fidele, and without thinking, he hurled him
full at the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog’s body broke the old sash and
crashed through the glass. The fellow vanished.
When Louis had regained his courage, he let
Fidele in. There was not a scratch on him.
He lay down about ten yards from Louis, and
looked at him fixedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old soldier had no sleep that night, and
no peace the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night was wild. Louis looked from
his window. The moon was shining brightly on
the icy fields that glared with as white a
radiance; over the polished surface drifted loose
masses of snow, and clouds rushed across the
moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his cloak, his stick, and a dirk-knife,
and locking Fidele in, started forth. A few
moments after he reached the rendezvous,
Jacques drove up in a berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is,” Jacques said, pressing a box
into his hands, “the key that hangs there will
open it. I must be off. Be careful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacques whirled away in the wind. There
was not a soul to be seen. Louis clutched his
knife, and turned toward home. He had not
left the church very far behind, when he thought
he heard something moving. A cloud obscured
the moon. A figure leaned out from under the
sidewalk and observed him. A moment later
it sprang upon the pathway and leaped forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis was sure some one was there; half
looking round, he made a swipe in the air with
his knife. It encountered something. Looking
round fairly he saw a man with a whitish cap
stagger off the sidewalk and fall in the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurrying on, he looked back a moment later,
and saw the figure of the man, receding, making
with incredible swiftness across the vacant space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louis once out of sight, the man doubled
with the rapidity of a wounded beast, and after
plunging through side-streets was again in front
of the farm-house. He ascended the ladder
with some difficulty, and entered the room by
the window. Where he expected to find his
faithful steward, there was only a white dog that
neither moved nor barked, and that watched
him fixedly as he fell, huddled and fainting, on
the bunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later Louis reached home.
The sickness of fear possessed him. He staggered
into the room and sat before the fire,
trying to control himself. When he was calmer,
he found himself clutching the box. He threw
off his cloak and took the key to fit it into the
lock. The key was too large. In vain he
fussed and turned—it would not go in. He
shook the box; nothing rattled or moved. A
horrid suspicion crossed his mind. What if
Jacques had stolen the money! What if there
was nothing in the box!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seized the poker in a frenzy and beat the
box open. It was empty—empty—empty!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand went round in it mechanically,
while he gazed, wild with conjecture. Then,
with an oath he flung the box on the fire and
turned away. The disturbed brands shot a
glow into every part of the room, and Louis
saw by one flash a gray Persian-lamb cap, which
he recognized, lying on the floor. By the next,
he saw the head, from which it had rolled,
pillowed on his bunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to utter a cry, but sank into his chair
stricken dumb; for death had not yet softened
the lines of desperate cunning on the face,
which, in spite of the scars of a wild life, he
recognized as that of Hugo Armand Theophile
Rioux.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look of that cap as he had seen it through
the window; the glimpse he had of it a few
minutes ago, when he swept his knife back
through the air; the face of his master—dead;
the thought of himself, duped and robbed, fixed
him in his chair, where he hung half-lifeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything reeled before him, but in a dull
glare he saw Fidele, his nose between his extended
paws, and his eyes fixed keenly upon
him. They seemed to pierce him to the soul,
until their gleam, which had followed him for
so many years, faded out with all the familiar
lines and corners of his room, engulfed in one
intense, palpitating light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people who broke open the house saw
the unexplained tragedy of the Seigniory, but
they did not find Fidele, nor was he ever seen
again.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>“J</span>OSEPHINE,” said Madame Labrosse,
quietly, through her tears—“Josephine,
we must set up a little shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said Josephine, with a movement of despair,
“Every one sets up a little shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, and what every one does we must do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not every one succeeds, and ours would
be a very little shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are some other things we could do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma,” said Josephine, “do not dare!
Let us set up a little shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And accordingly the front room was cleared
out and transformed. What care they took!
How clean it all was when they were at last
ready for customers, even to a diminutive sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter, who will wait?” asked
Madame Labrosse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will wait,” answered Josephine, and she
hung her bird in the window, put the door ajar,
and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was in the early summer, before the
Blanche had forgotten its spring song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” said Josephine, “we belong to the
people who do not succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True!” replied Madame Labrosse, disconsolately.
“But we must live, and there is the
mother,” and she cast her eyes to the corner
where her own mother sat, drawing at her pipe,
so dark and withered as to look like a piece of
punk that had caught fire and was going off in
smoke. “But there are some things we can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, do not <span class='it'>dare</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this time Madame Labrosse dared, and
she put on her cloak and went into the city.
When she came back her face was radiant, but
Josephine cried herself to sleep that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was in the early March, before the
Blanche had learned its spring song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, if the shopkeeping had been a
failure, was it the fault of Josephine or Madame
Labrosse? Their window was brighter than
other shop-windows, and one would have
thought that people would have come in, if
only to look at the sweet eyes of Josephine
and hear her bird sing. But, no! In vain for
months had the candy hearts and the red-and-white
walking-sticks hung in the window.
It was the crumble and crash of one of these
same walking-sticks that had startled Josephine
into the confession that the shop was not a
success. In vain had Madame Labrosse placed
steaming plates of pork and beans in the window.
Their savor only went up and rested in
beads on the pane, making a veil behind which
they could stiffen and grow cold in protest
against an unappreciative public. In vain had
she made <span class='it'>latire</span> golden-brown, crisp, and delicate;
it only grew mealy and unresisting, and
Josephine was in danger of utterly spoiling her
complexion by eating it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be something wrong with the
window,” said Madame Labrosse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I will walk out and see,” said Josephine,
and she came sauntering past with as
little concern as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, there is nothing wrong with the
window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait! I will try,” said Madame Labrosse,
and she in turn came sauntering by. But
Josephine had stood in the door, and her mother,
chancing first to catch sight of her, lost her
view of the window in her surprise at the anxious
beauty of her daughter’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! mamma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josephine, why did you stand in the door?”
asked her mother, kissing her on either cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the window?” persisted Josephine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the fiend fly away with the window!”
said her mother; and Josephine’s bird, catching
the defiance of the accent, burst into a
snatch of reckless song.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Now that Madame Labrosse had dared so
much, Josephine was not to be outdone, and
she commenced to sew. Her mother always
went away early in the morning and came back
before noon, and one day she caught Josephine
sewing. She snatched the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josephine, do not dare!” When she next
found her at work she said nothing, but instead
of kissing her cheek, kissed her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why was it that trouble seemed never
very far away? Josephine sewed so hard that
she commenced to take stitches in her side,
and of a sudden Madame Labrosse fell sick—so
sick that she could not do her work, and Josephine
had to go to the city with a message.
Her heart beat as she passed the office-doors
covered with strange names; her heart stopped
beating when she came to the right one. She
tapped timidly. Some one called out, “Come
in!” and Josephine pushed open the door.
There was a sudden stir in the room. The
lawyers’ clerks looked up, and then tried to go
on with their work. A supercilious young man
minced forward, and Josephine gave her message.
The clerks pretended to write, but the
only one who was working wrote Josephine’s
words into a lease that he was drawing—“the
said party of the second part <span class='it'>cannot come</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she went away, he leaned over the
supercilious young man and asked: “Where
did she say she lived?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At St. Renard,” said the young man; at
which every one laughed, except his inquirer.
He sat back in his chair, peering through his
glasses at the place where Josephine had stood.
St. Renard—St. Renard; was there ever such
a saint in the calendar? was there ever such a
suburb to the city? When he left the office he
walked as straight home as he could go. He
kept repeating Josephine’s words to himself:
“My mother, Madame Labrosse, being sick,
cannot come; she lives at”—St. Renard? No,
no; not St. Renard. When he had arrived at
the house, where he had boarded for ten years,
he went up to his room, and did not come
down until the next morning. When he had
shut himself in, he commenced to rummage in
his trunk, and at last, after tossing everything
about, he gave a cry of joy and pulled out a
flat, thin book. He spread this out on the
table and turned the leaves. On the first page
were some verses, copied by himself. The rest
of the book was full of silhouettes, cut from
black paper and pasted on the white. He found
a fragment of this paper, and taking his scissors
he commenced to cut it. It took the form of a
face; but, alas! not the face that was in his
mind, and he let it drop in despair. Then he
tried to sleep, but he could not sleep. Through
his head kept running Josephine’s message, and
he would hesitate at St. Renard, trying to remember
what she had said. At last he slept
and had a dream. He dreamed that he was
sailing down a stream which grew narrower and
narrower. At last his boat stopped amid a
tangle of weeds and water-lilies. All around
him on the broad leaves was seated a chorus of
frogs, singing out something at the top of their
voices. He listened. Then, little by little,
whatever the word was, it grew more distinct
until one huge fellow opened his mouth and
roared out “<span class='sc'>Viger!</span>” which brought him wide
awake. He repeated the word aloud, and it
echoed in his ears, growing softer and softer
until it grew beautiful enough to fill a place in
his recollections and complete the sentence—“My
mother, Madame Labrosse, being sick,
cannot come; she lives at Viger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next Sunday, Victor dressed himself
with care. He put on a new <span class='it'>peuce</span>-velvet coat,
which had just come home from the tailor’s,
and started for Viger. What he said when he
found Madame Labrosse’s he could never distinctly
remember. The first impression he
received, after a return of consciousness, was of
a bird singing very loudly—so loudly that it
seemed as if its cage was his head, and that, in
addition to singing, it was beating against the
bars. He was less nervous the next time he
came, and the oftener he came the more he wondered
at the sweetness of Josephine’s face. At
last he grew dumb with admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is very quiet, this Victor of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma!” said Josephine, consciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he never say a <span class='it'>word</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, what does he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, how can I remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, try, Josephine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said that now the leaves were on the
trees he could not see so far as he used to.
That before, he could see our house from the
Côte Rouge, but not now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, and what else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, how can I remember? He said
that the birds had their nests all built now.
He said that he wondered if any birds boarded
out; that he had boarded out for ten years.
Mamma, what are you laughing at? How
cruel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My little José, the dear timid one is in
love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, with whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell? I think he will tell you
some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the “some day” seemed to recede; and
all the days of May had gone and June had
begun, and still Josephine did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victor grew more timid than ever. Josephine
thought a great deal about his silence,
and once her mother caught her blushing when
he chanced to stir in his chair. She intended
to ask her about it, but her memory was completely
unhinged by a letter she received. It
was evidently written with great labor, and it
caused the greatest excitement in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon Dieu!” Madame Labrosse exclaimed,
“François Xavier comes to dine to-morrow!”
And preparations were at once commenced for
the reception of this François Xavier, who was
Madame Labrosse’s favorite cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His full name was François Xavier Beaugrand
de Champagne. He had just come down from
his winter’s work up the river, and on the
morning of the day he was to dine with his
cousin he stood leaning against the brick wall
of a small hotel in the suburbs. The sunlight
was streaming down on him, reflected up from
the pavement and back from the house, and he
basked in the heat with his eyes half shut. His
face was burned to a fiery brown; but as he
had just lost his full beard, his chin was a sort
of whitish-blue. He was evidently dressed with
great care, in a completely new outfit. He
appeared as if forced into a suit of dark-brown
cloth; on his feet he wore a tight pair of low
shoes, with high heels, and red socks; his
arms protruded from his coat-sleeves, showing a
glimpse of white cuffs and a flash of red under-clothes.
His necktie was a remarkable arrangement
of red and blue silks mixed with brass
rings. On his head he wore a large, gum-colored,
soft felt hat. He had little gold ear-rings
in his ears, and a large ring on his finger.
As he leaned against the wall he had thrust his
fingers into his pockets, and the sun had eased
him into a sort of gloomy doze; for he knew he
had to go to Madame Labrosse’s for dinner, and
he was not entirely willing to leave his pleasures
in the first flush of their novelty. He had made
arrangements to break away from the restraint
early in the evening, which softened his displeasure
somewhat; but when his friends came
for him he was loath to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How beautiful Josephine had grown, how kind
that cousin was, and how quickly the time
went,—now dinner, now tea; and who is this
that comes in after tea? This is Victor Lucier.
And who is this that sits so cheerfully, filling
half the room with his hugeness? This is
François Xavier Beaugrand de Champagne; he
has just returned. Just returned! Just returned
from where? What right has he to return?
Who is this François Xavier, who returns suddenly
and fills the whole room? Can it be so?
A vague feeling of jealousy springs up in Victor.
Can this be the one of Josephine’s choosing?
Yes, true it is; he calls her José. <span class='it'>José</span>, just like
Madame Labrosse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he is going now, and he is very loath to
go; but he will be back some day soon, and off
he goes. And by and by away goes Madame
Labrosse, “just for a moment,” she says. They
are alone now as they have never been before.
Josephine sits with the blood coming into her
face, wondering what Victor will say. Victor
also wonders what he will say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Josephine’s bird gives a faint, sleepy twitter.
They both look up, then he hops down from his
perch and pecks at his seed-font. Suddenly he
gives a few sharp cries, as if to try his voice.
They both start to their feet. Now he commences
to sing. What a burst of rapture! In
a moment Josephine is in Victor’s arms, her
cheek is against the velvet coat. Is it her own
heart she hears, or is it Victor’s? No need of
words now. How the bird sings! High and
clear he shakes out his song in a passionate
burst, as if all his life were for love. And they
seem to talk together in sweet unsaid words
until he ceases. Now they are seated on the
sofa, and Madame Labrosse comes in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Josephine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mamma, how can I help it?” and the tears
of joy creep out on her eyelashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the grandmother, catching sight,
through her half-blind eyes, of Victor and
Josephine on the sofa, cries out and menaces
him with her shrivelled fist, when they all rush
upon her with kisses and pacify her with her
pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, what is this noise that breaks the
quiet? It is a wild song from the street, echoing
in the room. There is a shout, and a cab
draws up at the door. It is François Xavier,
returned for the second time. He stands swaying
in the middle of the floor. There is a
vinous lustre in his eyes. His coat is thrown
back from his shoulder. Some one has been
dancing on his hat, for it is all crushed and
dusty. He mutters the words of the song
which the chorus is roaring outside—“C’est
dans la vill’ de Bytown.” Madame Labrosse
implores him with words to come some other
time. Josephine implores him with her eyes,
clinging to Victor, who has his arm around her.
But François Xavier stands unimpressed. Suddenly
he makes an advance on Josephine, who
retreats behind Victor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scoundrel! base one,” calls out Victor,
“leave the house, or I myself will put you
out!” François Xavier gazes for a moment
on the little figure peering at him so fiercely
through his spectacles. Then, as the chorus
lulls for a moment, a smile of childish tenderness
mantles all his face and with the gesture
of a father reclaiming his long-lost son he
stretches his arms toward Victor. He folds
him to his breast, and, lifting him from the
floor, despite his struggles he carries him out
into the night, where the chorus bursts out
anew—“C’est dans la vill’ de Bytown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is late when Victor at last escapes, and
hears them go roaring away as he flees, hatless,
through the fields to his home. It is still
later when he falls asleep, overcome by excitement
and the stimulants which have been
administered to him; and through his feverish
dreams runs the sound of singing, of Josephine’s
voice, inexpressibly sweet and tender, like the
voice of a happy angel, but the song that she
sings is—“C’est dans la vill’ de Bytown.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span><h1>THE PEDLER.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>H</span>E used to come in the early spring-time,
when, in sunny hollows, banks of coarse
snow lie thawing, shrinking with almost inaudible
tinklings, when the upper grass-banks are
covered thickly with the film left by the melted
snow, when the old leaves about the gray trees
are wet and sodden, when the pools lie bare
and clear, without grasses, very limpid with
snow-water, when the swollen streams rush insolently
by, when the grosbeaks try the cedar
buds shyly, and a colony of little birds take a
sunny tree slope, and sing songs there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He used to come with the awakening of life
in the woods, with the strange cohosh, and the
dog-tooth violet, piercing the damp leaf which
it would wear as a ruff about its neck in blossom
time. He used to come up the road from
St. Valérie, trudging heavily, bearing his packs.
To most of the Viger people he seemed to
appear suddenly in the midst of the street,
clothed with power, and surrounded by an
attentive crowd of boys, and a whirling fringe
of dogs, barking and throwing up dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I speak of what has become tradition, for
the pedler walks no more up the St. Valérie
road, bearing those magical baskets of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something powerful, compelling,
about him; his short, heavy figure, his hair-covered,
expressionless face, the quick hands
in which he seemed to weigh everything that he
touched, his voluminous, indescribable clothes,
the great umbrella he carried strapped to his
back, the green spectacles that hid his eyes,
all these commanded attention. But his powers
seemed to lie in those inscrutable guards to his
eyes. They were such goggles as are commonly
used by threshers, and were bound firmly about
his face by a leather lace; with their setting of
iron they completely covered his eye-sockets,
not permitting a glimpse of those eyes that
seemed to glare out of their depths. They
seemed never to have been removed, but to
have grown there, rooted by time in his
cheek-bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He carried a large wicker-basket covered
with oiled cloth, slung to his shoulder by a
strap; in one hand he carried a light stick, in
the other a large oval bandbox of black shiny
cloth. From the initials “J. F.,” which appeared
in faded white letters on the bandbox, the
village people had christened him Jean-François.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming into the village, he stopped in the
middle of the road, set his bandbox between
his feet, and took the oiled cloth from the
basket. He never went from house to house,
his customers came to him. He stood there
and sold, almost without a word, as calm as a
sphinx, and as powerful. There was something
compelling about him; the people bought things
they did not want, but they had to buy. The
goods lay before them, the handkerchiefs, the
laces, the jewelry, the little sacred pictures,
matches in colored boxes, little cased looking-glasses,
combs, mouth-organs, pins, and hair-pins;
and over all, this figure with the inscrutable
eyes. As he took in the money and made
change, he uttered the word, “Good,” continually,
“good, good.” There was something
exciting in the way he pronounced that
word, something that goaded the hearers into
extravagance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It happened one day in April, when the
weather was doubtful and moody, and storms
flew low, scattering cold rain, and after that day
Jean-François, the pedler, was a shape in memory,
a fact no longer. He was blown into the
village unwetted by a shower that left the streets
untouched, and that went through the northern
fields sharply, and lost itself in the far woods.
He stopped in front of the post-office. The
Widow Laroque slammed her door and went
upstairs to peep through the curtain; “these
pedlers spoiled trade,” she said, and hated
them in consequence. Soon a crowd collected,
and great talk arose, with laughter and some
jostling. Every one tried to see into the basket,
those behind stood on tiptoe and asked questions,
those in front held the crowd back and
tried to look at the goods. The air was full
of the staccato of surprise and admiration. The
late comers on the edge of the crowd commenced
to jostle, and somebody tossed a handful
of dust into the air over the group. “What
a wretched wind,” cried some one, “it blows
all ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dust seemed to irritate the pedler, besides,
no one had bought anything. He called
out sharply, “Buy—buy.” He sold two papers
of hair-pins, a little brass shrine of La Bonne
St. Anne, a colored handkerchief, a horn comb,
and a mouth-organ. While these purchases
were going on, Henri Lamoureux was eying
the little red purses, and fingering a coin in his
pocket. The coin was a doubtful one, and he
was weighing carefully the chances of passing
it. At last he said, carelessly, “How much?”
touching the purses. The pedler’s answer called
out the coin from his pocket; it lay in the man’s
hand. Henri took the purse and moved hurriedly
back. At once the pedler grasped after
him, reaching as well as his basket would allow;
he caught him by the coat; but Henri’s dog
darted in, nipped the pedler’s leg, and got away,
showing his teeth. Lamoureux struggled, the
pedler swore; in a moment every one was jostling
to get out of the way, wondering what was the
matter. As Henri swung his arm around he
swept his hand across the pedler’s eyes; the
shoe-string gave way, and the green goggles fell
into the basket. Then a curious change came
over the man. He let his enemy go, and stood
dazed for a moment; he passed his hand across
his eyes, and in that interval of quiet the people
saw, where they expected to see flash the two
rapacious eyes of their imaginings, only the
seared, fleshy seams where those eyes should
have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the vision of a moment, for the
pedler, like a fiend in fury, threw up his long
arms and cursed in a voice so powerful and sudden
that the dismayed crowd shrunk away, clinging
to one another and looking over their
shoulders at the violent figure. “God have
mercy!—Holy St. Anne protect us!—He
curses his Baptism!” screamed the women. In
a second he was alone; the dog that had assailed
him was snarling from under the sidewalk, and
the women were in the nearest houses. Henri
Lamoureux, in the nearest lane, stood pale, with a
stone in his hand. It was only for one moment;
in the second, the pedler had gathered his things,
blind as he was, had turned his back, and was
striding up the street; in the third, one of the
sudden storms had gathered the dust at the end
of the village and came down with it, driving
every one indoors. It shrouded the retreating
figure, and a crack of unexpected thunder came
like a pistol shot, and then the pelting rain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some venturesome souls who looked out when
the storm was nearly over, declared they saw,
large on the hills, the figure of the pedler, walking
enraged in the fringes of the storm. One
of these was Henri Lamoureux, who, to this day,
has never found the little red purse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have sworn I had it in this hand
when he caught me; but I felt it fly away like a
bird.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what made the man curse every one so
when you just bought that little purse—say
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I know not, do you? Anyway he has
my quarter, and he was blind—blind as a stone
fence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blind! Not he!” cried the Widow Laroque.
“He was the Old Boy himself; I told
you—it is always as I say, you see now—it
was the old Devil himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However that might be, there are yet people
in Viger who, when the dust blows, and a sharp
storm comes up from the southeast, see the
figure of the enraged pedler, large upon the hills,
striding violently along the fringes of the storm.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span><h1>PAUL FARLOTTE.</h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='float:left; clear: left; margin:0 0.1em 0 0; padding:0; line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 200%;'>N</span>EAR the outskirts of Viger, to the west, far
away from the Blanche, but having a country
outlook of their own, and a glimpse of a shadowy
range of hills, stood two houses which would
have attracted attention by their contrast, if for
no other reason. One was a low cottage, surrounded
by a garden, and covered with roses,
which formed jalousies for the encircling veranda.
The garden was laid out with the care and
completeness that told of a master hand. The
cottage itself had the air of having been secured
from the inroads of time as thoroughly as paint
and a nail in the right place at the right time
could effect that end. The other was a large
gaunt-looking house, narrow and high, with many
windows, some of which were boarded up, as if
there was no further use for the chambers into
which they had once admitted light. Standing
on a rough piece of ground it seemed given over
to the rudeness of decay. It appeared to have
been the intention of its builder to veneer it
with brick; but it stood there a wooden shell,
discolored by the weather, disjointed by the
frost, and with the wind fluttering the rags of
tar-paper which had been intended as a protection
against the cold, but which now hung
in patches and ribbons. But despite this dilapidation
it had a sort of martial air about it,
and seemed to watch over its embowered companion,
warding off tempests and gradually falling
to pieces on guard, like a faithful soldier
who suffers at his post. In the road, just between
the two, stood a beautiful Lombardy poplar.
Its shadow fell upon the little cottage in the
morning, and travelled across the garden, and in
the evening touched the corner of the tall house,
and faded out with the sun, only to float there
again in the moonlight, or to commence the
journey next morning with the dawn. This
shadow seemed, with its constant movement, to
figure the connection that existed between the
two houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garden of the cottage was a marvel;
there the finest roses in the parish grew, roses
which people came miles to see, and parterres
of old-fashioned flowers, the seed of which
came from France, and which in consequence
seemed to blow with a rarer color and more
delicate perfume. This garden was a striking
contrast to the stony ground about the neighboring
house, where only the commonest
weeds grew unregarded; but its master had
been born a gardener, just as another man is
born a musician or a poet. There was a superstition
in the village that all he had to do was
to put anything, even a dry stick, into the
ground, and it would grow. He was the village
schoolmaster, and Madame Laroque would
remark spitefully enough that if Monsieur Paul
Farlotte had been as successful in planting
knowledge in the heads of his scholars as he
was in planting roses in his garden Viger would
have been celebrated the world over. But he
was born a gardener, not a teacher; and he
made the best of the fate which compelled him
to depend for his living on something he disliked.
He looked almost as dry as one of his
own hyacinth bulbs; but like it he had life at
his heart. He was a very small man, and frail,
and looked older than he was. It was strange,
but you rarely seemed to see his face; for he
was bent with weeding and digging, and it
seemed an effort for him to raise his head and
look at you with the full glance of his eye.
But when he did, you saw the eye was honest
and full of light. He was not careful of his
personal appearance, clinging to his old garments
with a fondness which often laid him
open to ridicule, which he was willing to bear
for the sake of the comfort of an old pair of
shoes, or a hat which had accommodated itself
to the irregularities of his head. On the street
he wore a curious skirt-coat that seemed to be
made of some indestructible material, for he
had worn it for years, and might be buried in
it. It received an extra brush for Sundays and
holidays, and always looked as good as new.
He made a quaint picture, as he came down
the road from the school. He had a hesitating
walk, and constantly stopped and looked behind
him; for he always fancied he heard a voice
calling him by his name. He would be working
in his flower-beds when he would hear it
over his shoulder, “Paul;” or when he went
to draw water from his well, “Paul;” or when
he was reading by his fire, some one calling him
softly, “Paul, Paul;” or in the dead of night,
when nothing moved in his cottage he would
hear it out of the dark, “Paul.” So it came to
be a sort of companionship for him, this haunting
voice; and sometimes one could have seen
him in his garden stretch out his hand and
smile, as if he were welcoming an invisible
guest. Sometimes the guest was not invisible,
but took body and shape, and was a real presence;
and often Paul was greeted with visions
of things that had been, or that would be, and
saw figures where, for other eyes, hung only the
impalpable air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had one other passion besides his garden,
and that was Montaigne. He delved in one in
the summer, in the other in the winter. With his
feet on his stove he would become so absorbed
with his author that he would burn his slippers
and come to himself disturbed by the smell of the
singed leather. He had only one great ambition,
that was to return to France to see his mother
before she died; and he had for years been trying
to save enough money to take the journey.
People who did not know him called him
stingy, and said the saving for his journey was
only a pretext to cover his miserly habits. It
was strange, he had been saving for years, and
yet he had not saved enough. Whenever anyone
would ask him, “Well, Monsieur Farlotte,
when do you go to France?” he would answer,
“Next year—next year.” So when he announced
one spring that he was actually going,
and when people saw that he was not making
his garden with his accustomed care, it became
the talk of the village: “Monsieur Farlotte is
going to France;” “Monsieur Farlotte has
saved enough money, true, true, he is going to
France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His proposed visit gave no one so much
pleasure as it gave his neighbors in the gaunt,
unkempt house which seemed to watch over his
own; and no one would have imagined what a
joy it was to Marie St. Denis, the tall girl who
was mother to her orphan brothers and sisters,
to hear Monsieur Farlotte say, “When I am in
France;” for she knew what none of the villagers
knew, that, if it had not been for her and her
troubles, Monsieur Farlotte would have seen
France many years before. How often she
would recall the time when her father, who was
in the employ of the great match factory near
Viger, used to drive about collecting the little
paper match-boxes which were made by hundreds
of women in the village and the country
around; how he had conceived the idea of
making a machine in which a strip of paper
would go in at one end, and the completed
match-boxes would fall out at the other; how
he had given up his situation and devoted his
whole time and energy to the invention of this
machine; how he had failed time and again,
but continued with a perseverance which at last
became a frantic passion; and how, to keep the
family together, her mother, herself, and the
children joined that army of workers which was
making the match-boxes by hand. She would
think of what would have happened to them
then if Monsieur Farlotte had not been there
with his help, or what would have happened
when her mother died, worn out, and her
father, overcome with disappointment, gave up
his life and his task together, in despair. But
whenever she would try to speak of these things
Monsieur Farlotte would prevent her with a
gesture, “Well, but what would you have me
do,—besides, I will go some day,—now who
knows, next year, perhaps.” So here was the
“next year,” which she had so longed to see,
and Monsieur Farlotte was giving her a daily
lecture on how to treat the tulips after they had
done flowering, preluding everything he had to
say with, “When I am in France,” for his heart
was already there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had two places to visit, one was his old
home, the other was the birthplace of his beloved
Montaigne. He had often described to Marie
the little cottage where he was born, with the
vine arbors and the long garden walks, the
lilac-bushes, with their cool dark-green leaves,
the white eaves where the swallows nested, and
the poplar, sentinel over all. “You see,” he
would say, “I have tried to make this little
place like it; and my memory may have played
me a trick, but I often fancy myself at home.
That poplar and this long walk and the vines on
the arbor,—sometimes when I see the tulips
by the border I fancy it is all in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie was going over his scant wardrobe,
mending with her skilful fingers, putting a stitch
in the trusty old coat, and securing its buttons.
She was anxious that Monsieur Farlotte should
get a new suit before he went on his journey;
but he would not hear to it. “Not a bit of it,”
he would say, “if I made my appearance in a
new suit, they would think I had been making
money; and when they would find out that I
had not enough to buy cabbage for the soup
there would be a disappointment.” She could
not get him to write that he was coming. “No,
no,” he would say, “if I do that they will expect
me.” “Well, and why not,—why not?”
“Well, they would think about it,—in ten days
Paul comes home, then in five days Paul comes
home, and then when I came they would set the
dogs on me. No, I will just walk in,—so,—and
when they are staring at my old coat I will
just sit down in a corner, and my old mother
will commence to cry. Oh, I have it all
arranged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Marie let him have his own way; but she
was fixed on having her way in some things.
To save Monsieur Farlotte the heavier work,
and allow him to keep his strength for the journey,
she would make her brother Guy do the
spading in the garden, much to his disgust, and
that of Monsieur Farlotte, who would stand by
and interfere, taking the spade into his own
hands with infinite satisfaction. “See,” he
would say, “go deeper and turn it over so.”
And when Guy would dig in his own clumsy
way, he would go off in despair, with the words,
“God help us, nothing will grow there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Monsieur Farlotte insisted on taking
his clothes in an old box covered with rawhide,
with his initials in brass tacks on the
cover, Marie would not consent to it, and made
Guy carry off the box without his knowledge
and hide it. She had a good tin trunk which
had belonged to her mother, which she knew
where to find in the attic, and which would contain
everything Monsieur Farlotte had to carry.
Poor Marie never went into this attic without a
shudder, for occupying most of the space was
her father’s work bench, and that complicated
wheel, the model of his invention, which he had
tried so hard to perfect, and which stood there
like a monument of his failure. She had made
Guy promise never to move it, fearing lest he
might be tempted to finish what his father had
begun,—a fear that was almost an apprehension,
so like him was he growing. He was tall
and large-boned, with a dark restless eye, set
under an overhanging forehead. He had long
arms, out of proportion to his height, and he
hung his head when he walked. His likeness
to his father made him seem a man before his
time. He felt himself a man; for he had a good
position in the match factory, and was like a
father to his little brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the model had always had a strange
fascination for him, the lad had kept his promise
to his sister, and had never touched the mechanism
which had literally taken his father’s life.
Often when he went into the attic he would
stand and gaze at the model and wonder why it
had not succeeded, and recall his father bending
over his work, with his compass and pencil.
But he had a dread of it too, and sometimes
would hurry away, afraid lest its fascination
would conquer him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Farlotte was to leave as soon as
his school closed, but weeks before that he had
everything ready, and could enjoy his roses in
peace. After school hours he would walk in
his garden, to and fro, to and fro, with his
hands behind his back, and his eyes upon the
ground, meditating; and once in a while he
would pause and smile, or look over his shoulder
when the haunting voice would call his name.
His scholars had commenced to view him with
additional interest, now that he was going to
take such a prodigious journey; and two or three
of them could always be seen peering through
the palings, watching him as he walked up and
down the path; and Marie would watch him
too, and wonder what he would say when he
found that his trunk had disappeared. He
missed it fully a month before he could expect
to start; but he had resolved to pack that very
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is plenty of time,” remonstrated
Marie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s always the way,” he answered.
“Would you expect me to leave everything
until the last moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Monsieur Farlotte, in ten minutes
everything goes into the trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, and in the same ten minutes something is
left out of the trunk, and I am in France, and
my shoes are in Viger, that will be the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, to pacify him, she had to ask Guy to
bring down the trunk from the attic. It
was not yet dark there; the sunset threw a
great color into the room, touching all the
familiar objects with transfiguring light, and
giving the shadows a rich depth. Guy saw the
model glowing like some magic golden wheel,
the metal points upon it gleaming like jewels in
the light. As he passed he touched it, and
with a musical click something dropped from it.
He picked it up: it was one of the little paper
match-boxes, but the defect that he remembered
to have heard talked of was there. He held it in
his hand and examined it; then he pulled it
apart and spread it out. “Ah,” he said to
himself, “the fault was in the cutting.” Then
he turned the wheel, and one by one the imperfect
boxes dropped out, until the strip of paper
was exhausted. “But why,”—the question rose
in his mind,—“why could not that little difficulty
be overcome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the trunk down to Marie, who at
last persuaded Monsieur Farlotte to let her
pack his clothes in it. He did so with a protestation,
“Well, I know how it will be with a
fine box like that, some fellow will whip it off
when I am looking the other way, and that will
be the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he could do so without attracting
Marie’s attention Guy returned to the attic with
a lamp. When Marie had finished packing
Monsieur Farlotte’s wardrobe, she went home
to put her children to bed; but when she saw
that light in the attic window she nearly fainted
from apprehension. When she pushed open
the door of that room which she had entered so
often with the scant meals she used to bring
her father, she saw Guy bending over the model,
examining every part of it. “Guy,” she said,
trying to command her voice, “you have
broken your promise.” He looked up quickly.
“Marie, I am going to find it out—I can
understand it—there is just one thing, if I can
get that we will make a fortune out of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guy, don’t delude yourself; those were
father’s words, and day after day I brought him
his meals here, when he was too busy even to
come downstairs; but nothing came of it, and
while he was trying to make a machine for the
boxes, we were making them with our fingers.
O Guy,” she cried, with her voice rising into
a sob, “remember those days, remember what
Monsieur Farlotte did for us, and what he would
have to do again if you lost your place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all nonsense, Marie. Two weeks
will do it, and after that I could send Monsieur
Farlotte home with a pocket full of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guy, you are making a terrible mistake.
That wheel was our curse, and it will follow
us if you don’t leave it alone. And think of
Monsieur Farlotte; if he finds out what you
are working at he will not go to France—I
know him; he will believe it his duty to stay
here and help us, as he did when father was
alive. Guy, Guy, listen to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Guy was bending over the model, absorbed
in its labyrinths. In vain did Marie
argue with him, try to persuade him, and
threaten him; she attempted to lock the attic
door and keep him out, but he twisted the lock
off, and after that the door was always open.
Then she resolved to break the wheel into a
thousand pieces; but when she went upstairs,
when Guy was away, she could not strike it
with the axe she held. It seemed like a
human thing that cried out with a hundred
tongues against the murder she would do; and
she could only sink down sobbing, and pray.
Then failing everything else she simulated an
interest in the thing, and tried to lead Guy to
work at it moderately, and not to give up his
whole time to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he seemed to take up his father’s passion
where he had laid it down. Marie could do
nothing with him; and the younger children, at
first hanging around the attic door, as if he
were their father come back again, gradually
ventured into the room, and whispered together
as they watched their rapt and unobservant
brother working at his task. Marie’s one
thought was to devise a means of keeping the
fact from Monsieur Farlotte; and she told him
blankly that Guy had been sent away on business,
and would not be back for six weeks.
She hoped that by that time Monsieur Farlotte
would be safely started on his journey. But
night after night he saw a light in the attic
window. In the past years it had been constant
there, and he could only connect it with
one cause. But he could get no answer from
Marie when he asked her the reason; and the
next night the distracted girl draped the window
so that no ray of light could find its way
out into the night. But Monsieur Farlotte was
not satisfied; and a few evenings afterwards, as
it was growing dusk, he went quietly into the
house, and upstairs into the attic. There he
saw Guy stretched along the work bench, his
head in his hands, using the last light to ponder
over a sketch he was making, and beside him,
figured very clearly in the thick gold air of the
sunset, the form of his father, bending over
him, with the old eager, haggard look in his
eyes. Monsieur Farlotte watched the two
figures for a moment as they glowed in their
rich atmosphere; then the apparition turned
his head slowly, and warned him away with a
motion of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All night long Monsieur Farlotte walked in
his garden, patient and undisturbed, fixing his
duty so that nothing could root it out. He
found the comfort that comes to those who give
up some exceeding deep desire of the heart,
and when next morning the market-gardener
from St. Valérie, driving by as the matin bell
was clanging from St. Joseph’s, and seeing the
old teacher as if he were taking an early look
at his growing roses, asked him, “Well, Monsieur
Farlotte, when do you go to France?” he
was able to answer cheerfully, “Next year—next
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marie could not unfix his determination.
“No,” he said, “they do not expect me. No
one will be disappointed. I am too old to travel.
I might be lost in the sea. Until Guy makes
his invention we must not be apart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first the villagers thought that he was
only joking, and that they would some morning
wake up and find him gone; but when the
holidays came, and when enough time had
elapsed for him to make his journey twice over
they began to think he was in earnest. When
they knew that Guy St. Denis was chained to
his father’s invention, and when they saw that
Marie and the children had commenced to
make match-boxes again, they shook their heads.
Some of them at least seemed to understand
why Monsieur Farlotte had not gone to France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he never repined. He took up his garden
again, was as contented as ever, and comforted
himself with the wisdom of Montaigne.
The people dropped the old question, “When
are you going to France?” Only his companion
voice called him more loudly, and more
often he saw figures in the air that no one else
could see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early one morning, as he was working in his
garden around a growing pear-tree, he fell into
a sort of stupor, and sinking down quietly on
his knees he leaned against the slender stem
for support. He saw a garden much like his
own, flooded with the clear sunlight, in the
shade of an arbor an old woman in a white cap
was leaning back in a wheeled chair, her eyes
were closed, she seemed asleep. A young
woman was seated beside her holding her hand.
Suddenly the old woman smiled, a childish
smile, as if she were well pleased. “Paul,”
she murmured, “Paul, Paul.” A moment later
her companion started up with a cry; but she
did not move, she was silent and tranquil.
Then the young woman fell on her knees and
wept, hiding her face. But the aged face was
inexpressibly calm in the shadow, with the
smile lingering upon it, fixed by the deeper
sleep into which she had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually the vision faded away, and Paul
Farlotte found himself leaning against his pear-tree,
which was almost too young as yet to
support his weight. The bell was ringing from
St. Joseph’s, and had shaken the swallows from
their nests in the steeple into the clear air.
He heard their cries as they flew into his garden,
and he heard the voices of his neighbor children
as they played around the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the day he told Marie that his
mother had died that morning, and she wondered
how he knew.</p>
